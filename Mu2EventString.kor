Event_26201=What... is this I'm sensing?
Event_21301=Many animals have already been mutated. ¶The Evil Energy that did this... where is it coming from?
Event_21302=The Rarbas are creating the Evil Energy! ¶I can destroy the ones that aren't yet complete.
Event_21304=Kkeeekkeek! Kuhkikikik!
Event_21305=They're retreating too quickly. Could this be a trap?¶Well, I'll walk into it gladly. Someone has to get rid of them, anyway.
Event_21306=I can destroy incomplete Evil Energy.
Event_21308=Hundreds of creatures from Pandemonium are entering through the Evil Energy!
Event_21309=Maybe I should go that way...
Event_21311=An Evil Energy shield!¶To disarm the shield, I must destroy the Evil Energy generator.
Event_21310=Evil Energy!
Event_21313=The Evil Energy shield has been disarmed.¶Now I can destroy the Evil Energy generator in the center.
Event_26101=Toh! Panel Driver!
Event_26102=Coming here... to see me... ¶Do you have a death wish?
Event_26301=Sorry, am I late?
Event_26302=That was fun. Except for the Devias Knights, I've never seen anyone as fast as you.¶I'm a woman of her word.¶I'll ask Great Sage Zakarian about you.
Event_26303=Could you continue to help Leo? For us, that is.¶I'll come help you as soon as I'm done with my mission.
Event_21101=I told you they'd be back! ¶Imperial Guards! Charge!
Event_21102=Sorry, am I late?¶ For the honor of the Shadow Phantoms and Noria! Let's go!
Event_21103=Go take care of those Gargoyles... now!
Event_21104=Who dares try and awaken me?
Event_21105=I can smell the foul stench of the Grounders. All shall perish.
Event_21106=This must be the place where Glasha awakened.
Event_21107=Grounders! You shall be my first sacrifice...¶Your entire race will soon perish alongside you.
Event_21108=How could I fall to a mere Grounder...¶Who are... you... Arghh!
Event_21109=What's that crystal?¶It's giving off some kind of sinister energy.
Event_180001=I was told to enter first. Where is this guy?
Event_180002=Yes, yes... my hunch was right.
Event_180003=This means I can get out of this hellhole soon!
Event_180004=Sorry, but I've got to leave. I feel sick if I stay inside a Rift for too long.
Event_180005=Did he leave without hearing me out? Really?
Event_36101=Hmm, could this be one of the Dark Reaper's roots?
Event_36102=Hm? Something's wrong.
Event_31201=Who are you?¶Did Rickards send another assassin? That vulgar raiser of corpses...
Event_31202=You don't know me.¶Thank you, you've just confirmed that I'm not Pandemonium's puppet.
Event_31203=Answer me, Grounder. Are you one of Rickards' dogs?
Event_31204=I don't know who Rickards is, and I don't care. Prepare to die.
Event_31205=You're not working for Rickards? Then who are you exactly?!
Event_31206=Now I see... You're the Strange Slaughterer of Enova... Arghh...
Event_31701=Cerberus... Traitor of Karol Kingdom, mangy dog of Lorencia!
Event_31702=Cerberus... Where are you?!¶You pathetic dog of Lorencia who drove my people and Kingdom into destruction!
Event_31703=Calm down. Cerberus is dead,¶and now I have his necklace.
Event_31704=Do you think saying those words will bring my people back?I shall treat you the same!
Event_31705=Karolsandria is just the beginning.¶Everything that lives in the lands of your alliance shall perish.¶Right down to every single tree, and every blade of grass!
Event_31706=He didn't betray you. He led his army to Noria to win the war, and died during the Siege of Noria.
Event_31710=I don't believe it! That idiot killed the queen!¶Now all of my plans have been reduced to nothing...
Event_31711=Dark Mission, slay that bastard!
Event_31712=Zakarian, you traitor!¶You have disgraced Noria Kingdom and the Elves.
Event_31713=By the power of Noria's Crown Princess, I shall punish you!
Event_31714=Zakarian...¶Tell me the truth, and I'll give you a quick death. Why did you play me for a fool?
Event_31715=Because I received that necklace from a girl named Linda. There was nothing better to awake the Queen.
Event_31716=You used me to get rid of Sezak.¶I thought Pandemonium and the Mission were working together.
Event_31717=Sezak despised us for raising corpses.¶He called us disgusting.¶That blasted Pandemonium fool!
Event_31718=Rickards...¶You're the Rickards who sent assassins after Sezak.¶You were afraid he'd outshine you, weren't you?
Event_31723=Don't think this is over, Stranger.
Event_31719=What is this powerful energy?! I'd better go back to Lunedill.
Event_31720=I'm sorry I'm late.
Event_31721=It's okay. This is actually a surprise.¶It's good to see you. Let's get out of here.
Event_31724=Are you here for the Lightbringer as well?¶You foul Demon... This place will be your grave!
Event_31725=Queen Lenavis has been resurrected...?¶Could it be related to the proof from Karol that I found?
Event_31726=Knights of Karol!¶Arise and stop that Demon!
Event_31727=So you think anyone seeking the Lightbringer is a Demon?¶That's why no one has ever found the Lightbringer.
Event_31728=The Lightbringer is the symbol of the Karol Kingdom.¶You Demons are not fit to even hold it!
Event_31729=No... No!¶I can't let you take...
Event_31301=Who are you exactly?! First Enova, and now Duelden... ¶Why are you slaughtering the Pandemonium Army? Why?!
Event_31302=I can't remember who I am. Everyone keeps telling me I've to kill your kind to recover my memory.¶So, that's what I've been doing. I'll let you join your friends soon.
Event_31303=Pathetic being.¶You don't even know who you are, and you try to meddle in the business of others?
Event_31304=Sezak... He was an honorable man.¶Why did you kill him?!  Is that your definition of justice?
Event_31305=Zakarian told me where Sezak was,¶and asked me to kill him.
Event_31306=Zakarian was the one who instigated Sezak's death?  Zakarian!!¶Those devious Dark Mission... They betrayed us?
Event_31307=Strange Knight. Why don't we call a truce for the moment?¶I must get word of the Dark Mission's betrayal to Pandemonium.¶Open up the path, and...
Event_31308=Don't even think about it. This'll be your last moment on earth.
Event_31309=I can't believe the Dark Mission betrayed Pandemonium... You too will be playing into Zakarian's hands. Arghh...
Event_35301=They don't look like the Lorencia Royal Army.
Event_35302=I'd better take care of them first and ask Leo later.
Event_51201=Dracans Knight Scream!
Event_51202=The Dark Mission came as predicted...
Event_51301=We must buy time until the Tears are secured.¶Dark Mission, block them!
Event_51302=Was it a trap?! To lure me in...
Event_51303=Zakarian? You're the leader of the Dark Mission? Get out of here!
Event_51304=It's too late. Neria's Tears are now mine.¶Dark Mission, punish that soul!
Event_51305=It's time for you to die.
Event_51306=.........¶Don't think this is over, Stranger.
Event_51501=This must be the reset device. The key goes in here...
Event_51502=The fusion reactor has been reactivated!
Event_51503=Thank you, idiot.
Event_51504=The reset seems successful, but someone beat me to the Pectra.
Event_52101=I need to find another way.
Event_40501=The Tephakin Army is the enemy of we Garudas!
Event_40502=Destroy all the Tephakin Dukedom's supplies!
Event_40503=Occupy the airship!
Event_40504=Take every single thing you can find in the ship!
Event_40601=Greed, long time, no see.
Event_40602=Dumpain...! How did you know...?!
Event_40603=I know what you've been doing behind my back.¶You'd better not try anything stupid, or there will be consequences.
Event_40604=H-how dare you? You have no proof!¶You're only trying to get rid of your competition!
Event_40605=I do have proof.¶Do you see this fruit crate?
Event_40606=You're no longer welcome in Ohrdor. And you're not my competition. You never will be.
Event_40607=Get off me! I'll go on my own!¶Dumpain! You're no better than me!
Event_40608=Get him out of here!
Event_60901=Our last line of defense has been breached.¶Soon the Dark Shadow will be here. I hope you're ready.
Event_60902=Ashas won't forget what you did.¶Now, say goodbye to one another. We'll rest hereafter.
Event_60903=Got you! You little rat priests, die!
Event_110001=Is it because of the Rift warp? I feel sick...
Event_110002=The enemy grows stronger as we head deeper into the Rift!
Event_110003=The enemy is getting stronger due to the Rift warp!
Event_110004=Darn... What's that nasty smell?
Event_110005=Maybe someone can skip thousands of years through the Rift.
Event_110006=That horrible Dark Mission left their traces everywhere...
Event_110007=It reeks of those nasty monsters' blood...
Event_110008=I thought there would be gems everywhere when I heard it was a mine...
Event_110009=Remnants of ancient dwarves are everywhere... How far have I travelled back?
Event_110010=Heh, no one will find it if I hide it here. It's best to hog good ones for yourself!
Event_110011=Someone has been stealing the treasure I hid inside the Rift lately! Darn it! Who could it be?!
Event_110012=There's nothing you can get without effort in this world. Of course, it's your effort. Not mine. Ahahaha!
Event_110013=Did you think you could stop me with only this?
Event_110014=I will make you regret crossing paths with me in this infinite, Rift warp!
Event_110015=I wonder how many adventurers have died in this warp...
Event_110016=It'll be you who dies here!
Event_110017=That's a very old temple design... How far have I travelled back in time?
Event_110018=I've heard rumors about someone obtaining powerful equipment infused with the powers of the old God here...
Event_110019=This incredible energy from far away... It's making me nervous!
Event_110020=Do you want to take a bath in boiling lava?
Event_110021=Darn... I just want to take everything off, armor and all.
Event_110022=The heat of the lava grows stronger with the dimensional warp...
Event_110023=Past, future... Wherever, whenever we go... is always full of horrible monsters.
Event_110024=How much deeper does this warp go?
Event_110025=You know already, that the marvelous equipment found inside¶the Rift is our Society's main source of income.¶Without it, all of you would become... what?
Event_110026=Broke! Beggars!¶You'll all become beggars! If you find something useful inside the Rift,¶make sure to bring it to me... Ho ho ho...
Event_110027=...
Event_110028=Mukler was penalized due to a shameful event recently.¶If you try to trick me and take something for yourselves...¶Ho ho ho! Isn't it horrible, just imagining it?
Event_110029=Well... That's all for today's meeting.
Event_110030='Hm... I'll hide them deeper from now on.'
Event_110031=Blech... adventurers are amazing...¶How do they withstand this horrible stench in here?
Event_110032=This sewage...¶is the perfect grave site for the lot of you!
Event_110033=Filthy underlings of the demons...¶I'll chase down every single one of you no matter where you go.
Event_110034=Whoa! What... Did it just squish?
Event_110035=Are you telling me that a noble, elegant...¶Graceful, and dignified lady like myself¶is to go inside Gargamos' body?
Event_110036=Ahhhh! It's red! Ah!¶and... squishy! Ahhh! Get away from me!
Event_110037=Hm... That guy before... looked too weak.¶I'll feel bad if he dies...¶A few Sanctums will do...?

Event_140005=The Rift has infinite possibilities...¶Fortune... honor... power...
Event_140006=The problem is that there's also an infinite amount of monsters.

Event_140009=Defeat them to escape the Rift.

Event_151608=You living souls do not have the right to be here.
Event_151609=Our grudge will swallow the living!
Event_155301=Adjutant Majella of the Wallkreiger Royal Tomb Army, reporting to Your Excellency Sir Muren.
Event_155302=Adjutant? What about the messenger? What can I do for you?
Event_155303=(Cough)... Revenants have risen at the Royal Tomb.¶Devias Knights and the Royal Army have fought bravely, but the Royal Tomb has fallen.
Event_155304=Where's Commander Pilnell? Did the rest of the troops manage to get to safety?
Event_155305=The Commander sent me here just before our troops were vanquished. (Cough)... Ugh...
Event_155401=Wait, we've got company.
Event_155402=I'm not the only one who felt that. Enough of your tricks. Show yourself!
Event_155403=Sir Adrian sent me to kill you, Muren.¶Poor bastard, how can you live amongst such riff-raff?
Event_155501=Elders, the Pandemonium army is using the stolen Pectra for something big here at ¶the Sanctum of the Elders.¶In order to stop them, we must join forces with the Alliance. Please grant us your permission.
Event_155502=Have you lost your mind? The Nobility Alliance has invaded our land! No!
Event_155503=The Nobility Alliance is an independent force that sides with Pandemonium. ¶The person who defeated them is at the Mining Gorge. Listen to his story.
Event_155511=Stop! How dare you intrude on the Elder Council.
Event_155512=I've got urgent news. I need to see the chairman!
Event_155513=Stand back.
Event_155514=What is it, Dracans Warrior?
Event_155515=The Prison Camp has fallen to the Pandemonium Army.
Event_155516=The Prison Camp?! Are you saying over 10,000 prisoners have been let loose?!
Event_155517=An army of 10,000 has been deployed right in front of us. ¶We must cooperate with the Alliance to take back the camp before it's too late.
Event_155518=As the chairman of the Elder Council,  ¶I approve of this joint operation with the Alliance. It shall commence immediately!
Event_155519=Yes, sir!
Event_151610=Devias Knights... Are they here already?
Event_151611=You underestimated the Devias Knights, the best fighters on the MU Continent.
Event_151612=I'll clear a path. You go on ahead to the emperor's abode. I'll follow you soon.
Event_152001=100% pure crystals. From now on the Crystal Cave is yours, my Pandemonium guests.
Event_152002=Wow, they're of exquisite quality. This should be enough. Name your price!
Event_152003=Once the work is done, use it to level Drapia to the ground.¶Don't leave a single Dracans alive.
Event_152004=A rat has crawled in.
Event_152005=Take care of it.
Event_155601=Carved in stone. The person who tried to massacre us using the Wallkreiger Revenants has shown his face.
Event_155602=Are you forgetting the time you tried to wipe out Tephakin using Titans?
Event_155603=Now, now... Let's all calm down. Sir Kali, have you found anything?
Event_155604=I did get my hands on something. Take a look at this.
Event_155605=Aren't those Evil Energy? Pandemonium set them up everywhere ...
Event_155606=Yes, the Evil Energy... A tiny connection between Pandemonium and this realm... ¶What if we inject Pectra Energy into it?!
Event_155607=!!!!!!!!!! ¶I have the Pectra Crystal that Kalak gave me. Insert it and we'll see what it can do.
Event_155611=Everyone alright?
Event_155612=Did you see that? They plan to inject Pectra into the Evil Energy.
Event_155613=Pandemonic changes are already engulfing the land, which means the injection has begun.
Event_155801=I've been waiting. Have you found the Evil Energy Tunnel?
Event_155802=The Kanturian said there's Evil Energy in the two caves, especially the northern one.
Event_155803=It's just another diversion. ¶They're trying to confuse us. The tunnel must be in the northern cave.
Event_155804=I agree. Time is of the essence. I'll head out first.
Event_155805=W-wait...!
Event_155201=Stop. It'll be easy to blow you away, despite all the Pectra Energy around.
Event_155202=Let's see if your sleight of hand is faster than my weapon.
Event_155203=As you wish.
Event_155204=Stop, Father. You'll have to kill me first.
Event_155205=Five days. Bring back the Pectra Wand stolen by that darned Dracans. ¶I may be a day late, but I'll wipe all of you Grounders off the face of the earth.
Event_155206=Five days is hardly enough to stop Kalak before he destroys Drapia.
Event_155207=I had better hurry and let Chaisong know.
Event_55201=Failed again... We'll end up with a mountain of corpses at this rate.
Event_55202=Another... failure... Why won't it go in?
Event_55203=Finally! It worked!
Event_55204=Intruder! Holder of Pectra, get rid of him!
Event_52205=It's been a long time since I've seen a Grounder!¶I'm going to enjoy this.
Event_52206=Pretty strong for a Grounder. Although, that's no problem for me...
Event_52207=How slow can you be?¶Hurry up and get over here!
Event_52208=You don't disappoint! This is getting exciting. Come.
Event_52209=Don't forget, no presents for weak children.¶This is your punishment. Come back!
Event_52210=Aren't you giving up too fast?¶There's no charm in those who are impatient. I'll clear a path. Come!
Event_52211=I've been waiting for you. I'm looking forward to your incredible power.
Event_52212=Good, you're doing great! Come on now!
Event_52701=What, Neria's Tears!  I would've never guessed. What a jackpot!
Event_52702=You're sorely mistaken if you think I'll let you take it.
Event_52703=You disgusting reptiles... You can torment me no longer!
Event_52704=Have you lost your mind? You've betrayed your foster father, Chaisong!
Event_52705=Because he saved me, I took a beating from his kind every day when I was growing up. ¶Elyraq picked up my shattered soul and put it back together.
Event_52706=Neria's Tears... With this, I'm getting closer to Elyraq.
Event_52707=Chaisong's foster daughter was in league with Pandemonium!
Event_52708=There's no time to go after her. I must join the Union in the northern cave.
Event_65201=You've come this far... You're definitely one of my descendants. ¶Come stand in front of the Memory Recovery Device.
Event_65202=I will let you experience what I have experienced. ¶That would be the fastest way to understand what has happened so far...
Event_65203=From here on in, you shall become me and undergo various trials.
Event_65204=The reason that a mere junior officer like myself could become the Commander of the Coalition was not because of my ability to command.
Event_65205=My unit was ambushed by a group of Bull Horn Majors when I was a centurion, and I was awakened after seeing my dead comrades. ¶Since then, I've been capable of using my awakened power at will.
Event_65206=And the Three-year War with Pandemonium broke out shortly thereafter.
Event_65207=Pandemonium Army Commander Vurain tried to connect Noria's sky with Pandemonium using the Sky Cannon. ¶The plan was to drop a Pandemonium meteor upon Noria to bring about destruction.
Event_65208=But for some reason, Vurain's black magic did not work against me...
Event_65209=I was able to kill him and take away the two crystals used to activate the Sky Cannon ¶putting an end to the Three-year War between Pandemonium and Grounders.
Event_65210=I stored the two Blue Crystals, the key to activating the Sky Cannon, at Noria and Ashas.
Event_65211=And I positioned a mixed-blood family to guard the crystals instead of the Elves or the Ashas. ¶Because neither the Elves nor the Ashas trusted each other.
Event_65212=...After I died, my son was exiled to Dudrin City due to Lorencia fearing the awakened power.
Event_65213=The Lorencia Royal Army placed in Dudrin City was actually there to keep an eye on our family.
Event_65214=My descendant, your presence here is a proof of the mixed blood guards not being able to protect the crystals and my family's calling for me.
Event_65215=You have awakened to be my younger self through this trial. ¶Please bring peace back to this land.
Event_10101=You have finally come! Zephiros is deep within the Pandemonium area.¶You must go now!
Event_10102=You fools, your time is over.
Event_10103=You're not strong enough to seal me away this time!
Event_10104=Kethotoom's barrier is weakening!
Event_10105=Did we fail to seal him away?
Event_10106=How dare you resist me?! I will show you my power, even stronger now!
Event_10108=We won't last long.
Event_10109=The future of this world rests on your shoulders!
Event_10110=Go back in time and stop the god of evil from reviving at all costs!
Event_10111=Stranger...   Are you okay? Do you feel better now?
Event_10112=Wh-where am I? I can't remember anything...
Event_10113=You're awake. You've been asleep in my room for two days. Gather your strength first. I'll wait for you in the front of the house.
Event_10114=Who dares try to seal up Sekneum?!
Event_10115=I shall offer my body to God...
Event_10116=Arghhhh...!
Event_49301=Where am I? Yet another unfamiliar place.
Event_49302=What are you doing? We're not even halfway there!
Event_49303=Alright, Heyman. I'm right behind you!
Event_49304=Hm? Why did I just say that? And why did it feel so natural?
Event_49305=Am I... Am I really inside my own subconscious? Reliving my memories?
Event_49306=A Pandemonium Giant!
Event_49307=Grrrrr!
Event_49308=If it attacks us, we're doomed. Tread very, very carefully!
Event_49309=Phew, that was close.
Event_49310=Ambush! Pandemonium bastards! You won't stop us!
Event_49311=Now, %s_9_1. Run!
Event_49312=Grrrrr!
Event_49313=Crap, are we cut off?!¶Right... will this work?
Event_49314=Leave them to me, and hurry!
Event_49315=Come on, come on!
Event_49316=Take this, you freak!
Event_49317=Alright, it worked!
Event_49318=Good job, Heyman! We took out the Pandemonium giant!
Event_49319=Heh, the soldiers where we're headed won't believe this!
Event_49320=Darn it, a storm, at a time like this?! We need to steer clear of it!
Event_49321=%s_9_1, watch out!¶Ahh...!
Event_49322=Heyman...!
Event_49323=We're trapped! If we don't push them out, we'll never get through!
Event_49324=We did it! %s_9_1. The ally base is near!
Event_49325=Oh, no!
Event_49326=Damn it, it's too late!
Event_49327=Everyone... by that monster... I won't forgive you!
Event_49328=Aaarrgghh!
Event_49329=Heyman, NO!
Event_49330=Argh... Aaarrrggghh!
Event_49331='I think I remember now...'
Event_49332='Is this when I began to notice the uncontrollable power inside me?'
Event_49333=Those creatures from Pandemonium must have done it. I hope our camp is safe.
Event_49334=I hope it's still standing...
Event_49335=This is... terrible.
Event_49336=There's no time to lose, they need our help! C'mon, let's get going!
Event_49337=Nearly there... the Artillery Base is just up ahead.
Event_49338=We can't let the Pandemonium forces get their hands on our Imperial weapons.
Event_49339=We're almost at our headquarters. Let's keep going!
Event_49340=Grr-!
Event_49341=Shoot! I'm on my own!¶Here they come!
Event_49342=Uh oh, the giant's coming this way!¶Oh, try using this!
Event_49343=Heyman...¶Argh... Aaarrrggghh!
Event_49344=OK, I'm gonna break through. You take care of the rest here.
Event_49401='Where am I this time? What kind of memory is this?'
Event_49402=Listen, %s_9_1. The Temple is already under the control of the Pandemonium Army.
Event_49403=If the Temple falls, our minds will forever be enslaved by the Pandemonium Army...
Event_49404=We'll do whatever it takes to reclaim the temple of the greatest god!
Event_49405=Good, then go! May Rugard's blessing be with you.
Event_49406=No, stay focused! Everyone, stay focused!
Event_49407=All of them have lost their faith in Rugard... And you... What about you?
Event_49408=No way. I'll never submit to you!
Event_49409=Fine... Then prove your will...
Event_49410=Even the priests... Things are getting worse.
Event_49411=Watch... Even his followers have abandoned their faith in him... Now, come... embrace the darkness...
Event_49412=Rugard, in your name I fight! Please don't abandon me!
Event_49413=Get rid of all who resist us! Heavy Knights!
Event_49414=Now... No one else is alive. Are you really going to turn against the Dark side?
Event_49415=You're only kidding yourself. The almighty Rugard and the Archpriest are still watching over me!
Event_49416=You fool, you're just begging to be punished!
Event_49417=Aah, you're safe, I see.
Event_49418=Archpriest! What are you doing here? This place isn't safe.
Event_49419=Heh... no. Maybe not...
Event_49420=If your power goes to Pandemonium... it'll be a disaster for Rugard...
Event_49421=I cannot... just let that happen before my eyes...
Event_49422=Archpriest... Even you...
Event_49423=Rugard, have you forsaken us?
Event_49424='I lost my faith in god.'
Event_49425='Since then, I trusted no one but myself.'
Event_49426=Don't worry, Archpriest.
Event_49427=You taught us knights well?I'll gladly lay down my life for the Almighty Rugard.
Event_49501=(I feel dizzy, and I can't breathe... Where the hell am I...?)
Event_49502=For many years I've studied how to seal away the demons from Pandemonium - and their Demon God - that threaten the Earth. All to no avail.
Event_49503=But during my research, I discovered a path to the Heavens, the mythical domain of the gods.
Event_49504=At the end of the Heavens' Path must be the entrance to the Heavens that no one from the human realm has ever traveled.
Event_49505=If we reach the Heavens, maybe we can find the power to seal away the Demon God and his army.
Event_49506=Soon we'll see the Heavens' Path. We should stop the Demon God now!
Event_49507=This is the Heavens' Path, the way to the skies.
Event_49508=Mm... I must have strained myself. I'm afraid this is as far as I can go with you.
Event_49509=Head to the top of the Heavens' Path. Good luck opening the gates of the Heavens!
Event_49510=They're refusing anyone considered unworthy, ¶but I've come this far?I'm not leaving without a fight!
Event_49511=These guardians... They're strong!
Event_49512=Powerful Ether, grant me your power. Toh!
Event_49513=Ugh, I can't believe I lost...
Event_49514=Hey, lowlifes! Your beef is with me!
Event_49515=Ah, good to see that some knights are still alive. How'd you like to join me?
Event_49516=You're banged up pretty bad.
Event_49517=Argh... I'm hurt, bad. ¶I'll never get out of here alive... but I'll make sure you do.
Event_49518=Thanks. I owe you one.
Event_49519=I thought the Titans were the stuff of legend. This is no joke.
Event_49520=*Pant Pant* I'm not giving up! Not now!
Event_49521=I'm the best black knight there is ? I'm not going to die in a place like this!
Event_49522=Zephiros!
Event_49523=You're here?
Event_49524=Focus! Let's take care of them first!
Event_49525=Good, we don't have many chances left. Quick, let's go to the top of Heavens' Path!
Event_49526=Titans! Watch out! Arrgggh-!
Event_49527=Zephiros!
Event_49528=Zephiros can take care of himself. I must keep moving.
Event_49529=Toh-!
Event_49530=Go! Go to the Gate of the Heavens!
Event_49531=The ground's shaking as if it's angry at me for intruding.
Event_49532=Many people helped me come this far. Now everything depends on me!
Event_49533=Finally, I'm here...
Event_49534=We must combine all the Heavens' energy the guardians can wield!
Event_49535=Ugh, this is it...?
Event_49536=Aaarrrggghh-!
Event_49537=Your power has opened up a path.
Event_49538=Come... to this place...!
Event_49539=The Heavens... Have I arrived...?
Event_49540=Creature of the Gods, you've reached the forbidden area.
Event_49541=Show me your power. Prove to me you deserve to set foot in this place.
Event_49542=(The efforts and sacrifices of many have allowed me to reach this heavenly domain.)
Event_49543=(And here at the end of my journey, I've finally transcended my human limits.)
Event_49544=Aaarrrggghh-!
Event_49545=Zephiros!
Event_49546=Such immense energy...! What is this ray of light...?
Event_49547=Dragon of the Heavens, follow my lead!
Event_49548=Pathetic humans, do not dare set foot in this sanctuary. Leave now and save yourselves.
Event_49549=Earthly creatures like you don't belong here. You've already committed enough sins to deserve eternal punishment.
Event_49550=Foolish creatures, you dare challenge the authority of the gods?
Event_52501=Now all the prisoners inside the Prison Camp will mutate.
Event_52502=It's gotten smaller again. Inject more Pectra energy!
Event_52503=What now? Pandemonium.
Event_52504=I have no beef with you, I'm just trying to survive.¶So stop following me, you pesky Grounders!
Event_960001=Lu... Lupa! Where are you?! Lupa!¶(Sigh)... Now where has he run off to...?
Event_960002=Why do I keep hearing a pig oink...?¶How annoying...
Event_960003=Ah! Lupa, you were here...¶Ugh! W-what are you...
Event_960004=Ah... you talk too much...¶It's very bothersome... and noisy...
Event_960005=Please... save me...¶Why... why...
Event_960006=Heh... Is it because of the size...?¶You just won't quit...¶Die already! Die! Die! Die!! You idiot!
Event_960007=Heh... hehehehehe... I feel...¶I feel refreshed now... Freedom... Hahaha!
Event_960008=I can feel a destructive warp beyond that door!¶Where does it lead?
Event_960010=Who dare come here, looking for us?¶You're not welcomed here!
Event_960011=If you want to get in, you'd better get past me first.¶Bring it on!
Event_960012=No one can see Lupa's real form...¶Lupa!
Event_960201=You shall also be bridled by these terrible chains of eternity!
Event_960202=All of you!You shall be bridled by these terrible chains of eternity!
Event_960203=The light... I can see... the end... Too bright...
Event_960301=Here comes yet another fool stuck in the endless cycle.¶I'd better put you out of your misery!
Event_960302=I was the one... stuck... Yes, I hope... I was the last one...
Event_33201=The door blocking the way disappeared.
Event_33202=This place is not it. ¶I'd better get back on the right path.
Event_33203=This place is not it. ¶I'd better get back on the right path.
Event_33204=This place is not it. ¶I'd better get back on the right path.
Event_33205=This place is not it. ¶I'd better get back on the right path.
Event_52901=You're too late. Grounder... When the Evil Energy Tunnel is complete, your kingdoms on Earth will crumble to ashes.
Event_52902=The Evil Energy Tunnel will soon be completed. Block them! Even if it requires your life...¶Don't let the Grounders near the Tunnel!
Event_52903=You're rambling. Nervous?You Pandemoniums always talk too much.
Event_53401=Thank the gods, we made it in time.
Event_53402=Time to stretch your legs a bit.
Event_53403=That must be the Evil Energy Tunnel...
Event_53404=It's done! Soon enemies will come pouring out by the hundreds!
Event_53405=You've been seriously hurt, how are you holding up?
Event_53406=You don't look so well yourself. The Devias Knights aren't as good as people say they are.
Event_53407=Let's save family matters for later, and destroy this first.
Event_53408=It wouldn't budge. Is this the end?
Event_53409=...It was an honor to fight beside you, Humans. Cast Dracan Suicide!
Event_53410=You want to self-destruct? Don't! You'll only bring great shame upon us!
Event_53411=Sorry, research is finished.
Event_64201=Brothers, this tunnel will take us safely to the World Tree.
Event_64202=Let's make the elves pay for breaking our peace treaty and creating secret weapons behind our backs!
Event_64203=Intruder! ¶Brothers, punish that intruder!
Event_60501=For the glory of the great Ashases!
Event_60502=Arghâ€”arggghh!
Event_60503=The World Tree wasn't a simple tree!¶The Ashas priest was telling me the truth!
Event_60601=I did it!I destroyed its roots.
Event_64301=According to my intel, the Bulldog Orcs that infiltrated the temple have set up a bomb in the center of the building.
Event_64302=It'll blow up the sanctum of us elves.¶We must stop it at all costs.
Event_64303=To disarm the bomb safely, I need to see its schematics.¶The Bulldog Orcs have to have them.
Event_64311=The worst is over, but Ashas reinforcements haven't stopped coming into the temple.
Event_64312=I won't last long against them. Don't you have a good idea?
Event_64313=They leave me little choice. I'll have to awaken the Guardian of the temple and unleash him.
Event_64314=The Guardian? If you can do that, why didn't you do it earlier?
Event_64315=Guardian Breezecu is so dreadfully powerful that he must only be used as a last resort.
Event_64316=So far he's only been a symbolic figure, having never been awakened, but now he's our only hope.
Event_64317=Awakening the Guardian requires certain artifacts inside the temple.¶I'm afraid the Ashas Army has stolen all of them.
Event_64318=Retrieve the artifacts from the enemy and bring them to the Altar of the Guardian.Hurry!
Event_64321=Guardian, watch and listen!¶I offer you the Artifact of Wisdom. Rise and join us!
Event_64322=The ritual must have been successful.¶Now go to the Gallery of Wisdom and join the Guardian in his fight with the Ashas Army!
Event_64323=Did the ritual really go well?¶Why can't I shake this bad feeling?
Event_64401=The Guardian has awakened safely.
Event_64402=All right, now we can track down the remaining enemyâ€”
Event_64403=Mm? Something's wrong! Watch out!
Event_64404=Oh no, the Guardian is raging out of control!¶Those nasty Ashases, they must have done something foul to the Artifact we offered him!
Event_64405=Darn it, he's now more threatening than the Ashases.¶Let me take care of him!
Event_64406=While you took care of the Guardian, the Ashases have reached the chapel.¶Oh no, I think I know why they're there.
Event_64501=With this, we've expressed our will.
Event_64502=There will be no more peace in Noria!
Event_64503=You must be the one who's been following us.¶Focus on your telepathy. We'll attack as one!
Event_64504=What's that? It dropped from the goddess statue.
Event_64505=W-wait!
Event_64601=Dark Shadows are lying in wait. Be careful.
Event_64602=Shadow Phantom! Cut a path for the Strange Knight!
Event_64603=Stop the Dark Shadow, disgrace to us elves!
Event_64701=The mummies that protect our ancient sages have awakened. They won't tolerate intruders.
Event_64702=You must defeat the mummies. I'll wait for you at the front.
Event_64801=Is he an ancient sage of the Ashases?¶Wait, something's wrongâ€”oh no,it's black magic!
Event_64802=No! This is blasphemy!
Event_64803=Damn it, we have no choice. Defeat them. Fratanne!
Event_64804=...*Sigh* Please. Please let him rest in peace once again...
Event_64901=Ashases, I'll make you pay. Fire!
Event_64902=Wait, I'm not going to lose you this time.
Event_64903=Don't follow me, or else...
Event_64904=I hope I'm not late this time. Now this is the power of the Shadow Phantoms commander!
Event_65501=What the...? What's going on? Drat... I can't move!
Event_65502=Keh heh, I got you, you numbskull.¶I knew you'd take the bait.
Event_65503=.....
Event_65504=Mission accomplished. Keh heh...
Event_65505=Zakarian! What are you up to this time?
Event_65506=These crystals are the guardian stones of the elves' and the Ashas' spirits.
Event_65507=Now that they're destroyed, it's only a matter of time before the two races fall. Hah hah hah...
Event_65508=Half-breed, finish that rat.

Event_65511=Hah hah, too late, you fools.¶Struggle all you want.
Event_69501=I shouldn't have used the dark elves.¶I can't believe they lost so easily to a strange knight from some foreign land.
Event_69502=They've grown incredibly strong since the last time we met them.¶They're not easy prey.
Event_69503=But at least we've accomplished what we wanted.
Event_69504=...!¶My Queen, how can you be so cruel?
Event_69505=Lunedill, I knew you'd get in my way one day.
Event_69506=I'll punish you along with your strange friend!
Event_69521=Unbelievable. You've managed to ruin my plans.
Event_69522=I've underestimated you, visitor from a different age.
Event_69523=...!?
Event_69524=This is only the beginning.¶Resist all you want, but we will conquer your world soon.
Event_69525=In the end, you are nothing in the face of the great Demon god's power.¶Mwa hah hah hah!
Event_68501=Are you Baraex?Why are you doing this?
Event_68502=The Ashases had it coming. I tried to blend in, did my best to get acknowledged.¶But they treated me like a mongrel!
Event_68503=But these Ashases are innocent!
Event_68504=When they realized I was different, they laughed in my face and left me.¶You think these Ashases are innocent.Wrong!
Event_68505=I'll wipe the Ashases off the face of this earth.¶They can scream, but I'm not going to listen to them.Why would I? They didn't listen to me!
Event_1000001=How did you find this place? Who are you!?
Event_1000002=A pitiful being.
Event_1000003=Are you not afraid of death?!

Event_1000052=How did you find my dwelling?!
Event_1000053=You're looking for Sezak. You've come to the wrong place, Grounder.
Event_1000054=Tired already, Grounder? Is it too much for you?
Event_1000055=You'll never find Sezak!
Event_1000056=Killing me won't change anything!

Event_1000075=Ahhhhhh...!
Event_1000081=Rickards... No, how could Zakarian betray us... That bastard...
Event_1000082=You dare face me? How unwise...
Event_1000083=Strange Knight, why don't we call a truce for the moment? I must inform Pandemonium of the Dark Mission's betrayal.
Event_1000084=Won't you side with Pandemonium? What do you desire?
Event_1000085=You too will be playing into Zakarian's hands. Arghh...
Event_1000086=You will not get out of here alive... Arghh...
Event_1000091=How dare such a petty creature awaken me. I shall rip you apart.

Event_1000162=Ha... Did the Dark Mission seem too easy? I will show you the essence of black magic.
Event_1000163=Time is on my side, Grounder. The Dark Mission will take Neria's Tears.

Event_1000184=Waaah!
Event_1000191=I thought I killed all the Tephakins. Hm? You're not from the Tephakin Army...
Event_1000192=Go back. Lowly commoners don't belong here.
Event_1000193=This power!  Who are you?!  Are you a watchdog of that Devias, Muren?
Event_1000194=Being dragged by someone who's not even a noble... What a disgrace.
Event_1000195=Waaah!
Event_1000201=Don't take me lightly just because I'm a gatekeeper. As long as I, Pandemonium 17th Brigade Commander Boobalus, am here, none shall pass.

Event_1000203=Not bad... But I shall stake my soul in protecting the laboratory.
Event_1000204=Grounders... I can smell your foul stench from here...
Event_1000205=Woongpam, you must escape!
Event_1000206=Am I going to die like this?

Event_1000254=Argh... How could I be defeated...
Event_1000255=Wallkreiger shall last forever...!
Event_1000261=Who dares challenge me?!
Event_1000262=Did Dargon send you?! He is only jealous of my strength.
Event_1000263=I will destroy your soul!
Event_1000264=Ah... I was to be immortal...
Event_1000265=Everything... burnt to white ash...
Event_1000271=I could hear the echo of your powerful soul!

Event_1000306=This dark swamp will be your grave!
Event_1000307=Ashas, bring me glory!
Event_1000308=No... Ashas... I'm sorry...
Event_1000309=Get away! From me! You worms!
Event_1000310=No one! Can get! Past here!
Event_1000311=Filthy mongrel! You don't! Belong here!

Event_1000322=Ugh... My beautiful scales... Scattered like ash...
Event_1000323=Aaawww... Is this the end for us Nagas...?
Event_1000324=I am the protector of this place. Strangers are not welcome.
Event_1000325=I'll take care of you, intruders!
Event_1000326=I won't let you defile this refuge for noble souls!
Event_1000327=You might get past me, but you won't get past the spirits of the deceased!
Event_1000328=Ah... I've sacrificed so much to protect it all, but it was all for nothing...
Event_1000329=Ah! Kwaaakkkk!
Event_1000330=Pain... hatred... anger burning inside me...!

Event_1000345=Ugh... Ughkk... Your Majesty. Forgive me, but I must retreat for now.¶I swear, however, that they'll suffer. Next time, they'll know the true power of darkness...
Event_1000401=We've got an urgent message.¶A total war has broken out between the elves and the Ashas in East Noria!
Event_1000402=What?!
Event_1000407=The flowers are showing some strange symptoms. ¶Please destroy all the strange-looking flowers in about 10 minutes, and let me collect their cells.
Event_1000408=The door to the control room has been opened. Let's go.
Event_1000409=The pollen will stop spreading now. ¶The door to the control room has been opened. Let's go inside.
Event_1000410=I need samples of that rare fruit, too. ¶Please don't forget to destroy any that you run into.
Event_1000411=Hey, you! Come see me before you go in, will you?
Event_1000412=I'm trying to find out what made this place change like this. Please help me out here.
Event_1000413=Look at these mutant plants. Please destroy them.

Event_1000420=There was some kind of mechanical device somewhere around here... ¶Ah, there it is.

Event_1000422=I am sorry for what happened earlier...
Event_1000423=The bees followed us here. ¶Get rid of them quickly and move.
Event_1000424=We're almost there. ¶Hang in there.
Event_1000425=I want to stay here and analyze all this for a little longer. I'll follow you soon. ¶Just go on without me.
Event_1000426=*Gasp* I pushed the wrong button. ¶Run! Hurry!
Event_1000427=That was close. ¶Thanks for getting rid of all that fruit, even while you were running. ¶You can go down after this door.
Event_1000428=Phew...¶I'm glad nothing happened.¶Let's go down now.
Event_1000429=Thank you for clearing the path down to this point. ¶This is the last door.

Event_1065901=Is that the Pentacle that was used to render Bellias unconscious?
Event_1065902=The infected Sanctum is healing the monsters.
Event_1065903=A light at a place like this...
Event_1065904=The lights are being gathered somewhere.
Event_1065905=They won't stop coming!
Event_1065906=Tsk! Exploding ones? How frustrating.
Event_1065907=Hm... We should unseal the two seals of the Pentacle first.
Event_1065910=I can smell that Grounder hiding somewhere around here...
Event_1065911=I wonder if she's escaped here safely.
Event_1065912=Keh heh heh. How dare you set foot in this place? I'm going to chop you up.
Event_1065913=Eliminate intruders... Must eliminate intruders...

Event_1100003=You must be Linda.¶I've heard so much about your grandfather, Master Cerberus, from Her Majesty.
Event_1100004=I found something extraordinary while going through his personal items. ¶It is about the necklace that I gave to you before.
Event_1100005=Necklace? What could be here that...
Event_1100006=Ah... I see you two have a lot of catching up to do.¶Why don't we speak to Her Majesty first?
Event_1100007=The road may be too dangerous for a young lady to travel alone. Why don't you escort her?
Event_1100010=It is an honor, Your Majesty. ¶Linda, at your service.
Event_1100011=Are you... the granddaughter of Cerberus? ¶I received word of your arrival. ¶Come here, let me see your face.
Event_1100012=I see... in your face... the face of my old friend. ¶I had forgotten his face after all these years... ¶but now I remember.
Event_1100013=(She's so... I never knew she had such a soft side!)
Event_1100014=You may leave now. ¶And... can you tell me why you've come here?
Event_1100015=I found a journal while gathering his belongings. The journal had some important information about the necklace. I came here to deliver that information.
Event_1100016=Wait... Yes, the necklace... Cerberus wore it around his neck at all times.¶But why do you have it?
Event_1100017=I gave it to him, as a token of gratitude. He... saved my life.
Event_1100020=A girl named Linda told me about it.¶Do you have the gems? All four of them?¶Then, give them to me.
Event_1100021=If the journal is right, there are not many who can break the seal... Me, of course, and maybe Etramu...
Event_1100022=Let's begin right away.
Event_1100023=Did it work?¶The power is truly amazing...¶It is the power of Akneria, the creator, after all.

Event_1800308=Protect the Wardstone!
Event_1800309=The Wardstone! At this rate, we will all die here. Protect the other two at all costs!
Event_1800310=See that? They're coming wave after wave!
Event_1800311=They just keep coming! Stay sharp!
Event_1800312=The Monsters have stopped coming.¶Now we can just round up the stragglers.
Event_1800313=Good, a worthy opponent has emerged!
Event_1800314=Um, it's stronger than I thought. Let's give it all we got!
Event_1800315=We did it! We won!
Event_1800316=Ugh, it's tougher than I thought. Is this the end of us?
Event_1700101=Ah, thank the gods you're here!¶A powerful entity has emerged from the Rift.
Event_1700102=I can sense its overwhelming presence nearby. Stay on guard!
Event_1700103=Damn, it got away.¶Something that huge can't be too hard to find. Let's get after it, now!
Event_1700104=This isn't good. Let's keep looking.
Event_1700105=Huh... Where did it go this time?
Event_1700106=Yes! That's how it's done!
Event_1700107=We don't have much time!
Event_1700108=It's getting ready to take flight! Stop it!
Event_1700109=Don't hesitate! Don't let it run away!
Event_1700110=It can't get away this time!
Event_1700111=It's putting up a good fight. I don't know if we can keep it from running this time.
Event_1700112=Find it!
Event_1700113=Ugh! It's so strong! Let's take a breather.
Event_1700114=Let's go! This time we'll finish it once and for all!
Event_1700115=You stopped it! Impressive.
Event_1700116=Oh! You stopped it! Now to finish it once and for all!
Event_1700117=You defeated that abomination! It's been a great honor to fight alongside you.
Event_1700118=If it weren't for you, we'd never have stopped it.
Event_1700201=Ah... it's you!¶Just in time! A powerful entity has emerged from the Rift.
Event_1700202=It must be nearby, I can sense its overwhelming presence. Stay sharp!
Event_1700203=Damn, it ran.¶A creature of that size doesn't have many places to hide. Let's find it, quick!
Event_1700204=It got away again. Keep your eyes peeled!
Event_1700205=Watch out, it moves like no creature I've seen before!
Event_1700206=Good job! Now we have the upper hand!
Event_1700207=We're running out of time!
Event_1700208=It's getting ready to take flight! Let's stop it!
Event_1700209=Don't give it a chance to get away!
Event_1700210=Corner it! Don't let it get away this time!
Event_1700211=This one's tough! It won't be easy to subdue.
Event_1700212=We must find it!
Event_1700213=Even you have a hard time dealing with it. It must be special.
Event_1700214=Let's follow it, and finish it once and for all!
Event_1700215=You fought well. Good job!
Event_1700216=Nicely done! Seize this opportunity!
Event_1700217=Ah, you defeated that abomination! I knew you wouldn't disappoint me!
Event_1700218=Even you can't stop it... Is it invincible?
Event_1700301=Did you see that?¶A powerful otherworldly creature has emerged from the raging Rift.
Event_1700302=I'm sensing murderous vibes not far from us. Be prepared for the worst!
Event_1700303=Damn, it made a run for it!¶But it's too big to hide in a corner. Let's find it!
Event_1700304=It ran. You're not going to let it get away, are you?
Event_1700305=It's more unpredictable than I thought.
Event_1700306=You bound it! Good job!
Event_1700307=We can't afford to relax right now!
Event_1700308=It's moving suspiciously. Why would it turn its back to us?
Event_1700309=Keep it up, or it'll get away!
Event_1700310=Letting it get away will seriously complicate things! Stop it at all costs!
Event_1700311=It's tougher than I thought. It might take more than one blow to finish it.
Event_1700312=Alright, let's follow it!
Event_1700313=It is still standing! This is going to take longer than I thought!
Event_1700314=Let's not give it a chance to run. I really want to see it drop this time!
Event_1700315=Aww, that must hurt! I'm glad I'm on your side.
Event_1700316=Serves it right! Good, now we have the upper hand!
Event_1700317=It's down! That was incredible!
Event_1700318=The strongest forces on the continent have fallen like leaves. What a shame!
Event_1700330=There's some blood. It's somewhere around here!
Event_1700331=I've found its tracks!
Event_1700332=It can't have gone too far, bleeding so much.
Event_700501=Krrr...
Event_700502=You killed all my men, and took away their chances of regeneration...
Event_700503=This is unforgivable!
Event_700504=I waited for a chance to take my revenge in the depth of the netherworld... and the searing rage revived me.
Event_700505=I will be waiting at the place of our last fight... This time, I will crush you like a bug. Umhahahaha...
Event_700701=This will be the end for you!
Event_700702=Hmph... I will not be defeated in front of my men!
Event_700703=Arrrgh!! Larvas...!!
Event_701501=Kyaoooh!
Event_701502=How dare you hurt the one who awakened us to our wild power!?
Event_701503=But it's too late. No one can stop our thirst for blood now!
Event_701504=Grr... I'll kill you soon. Wait for me...
Event_701701=Grr, you fool. I'll skin you alive!
Event_701702=Grr, don't underestimate my wild power!
Event_701703=Kuoohhharrrggghh!
Event_711401=Who are you!?
Event_711402=This energy... The king of the gods...!?
Event_711403=No. This is... fake.
Event_711404=Who dares imitate the king of the gods? Blasphemous!
Event_711405=Pay with your life!
Event_710801=Good job finding this place, Grounders. You can't kill me. Ever!
Event_710802=Krrgggh, no... I don't have enough Evil Energy yet...!
Event_710803=Kwoohhh... Kwarrrggghh!
Event_707901=Gghh... Ggghhhkkk...
Event_707902=Ggghhhkkk... M-my... I-I... return...
Event_707903=F-forgive... all my sins... The far...
Event_707904=I... I'm... going back... the far... high... where I was... The distant... light of eternity...
Event_707905=Good, good. Things are going smoothly. If this continues, all shall proceed as it should...
Event_707906=........
Event_707907=Oropher... Arkius... The sinners who went against the light...
Event_707908=You were already banished and left behind. You can no longer be with us.
Event_707909=Mekrare... Merekra... Da... Laochere...
Event_707910=Oh, no. This can't be happening!
Event_707911=Oh, no, Orman...!? Watch out, Icarus! Get out of here!
Event_707912=Kwwgggghh... I... I... I... I'm a captive of the darkness...
Event_707913=Karrr! Wooohhhh...!
Event_713901=Keh heh heh, foolish Grounders...
Event_713902=....!?
Event_713903=Thanks for destroying all our breeding grounds. That let me absorb all the nutrients and resurrect like this.
Event_713904=I haven't felt so full for a long time. Now, nothing can stop Elyraq!
Event_713905=With this power, I'll devour every living thing on this icy continent that you cherish so much. Bwa hah hah hah!
Event_714301=You were the one who ruined our great plan. You deserve to be my first sacrifice after my resurrection!
Event_714302=Hmpf, stop fighting and be my nourishment!
Event_714303=Kwaaarrgggh! I got beaten by Grounders, again!
Event_706201=I see Datans guarding the entrance...¶Something must be going on inside.
Event_706202=I see the main force of the Demon army.¶We will crush them all.
Event_706203=You clearly do not know where you stand.¶Come out! Crush the enemy!!
Event_706301=Come...¶I will rip you to pieces!
Event_706302=Boobalus is alive...?!¶Has he been resurrected? Datans... Now they are fighting for the Demons?
Event_706303=You'll need more than that to stop us!!!
Event_706304=You bested me once again... but... you're too late.
Event_706401=So they were creating Datans here...
Event_706402=Who let them through?!¶Stop them! Don't let them follow him!
Event_706403=Ah... too late. I am sorry, friend.¶What did you find out about them?
Event_706404=By the time I arrived, they'd already left.¶I think we have to figure something else out.
Event_706501=This place reeks of Demons...
Event_706502=There are so many Demon soldiers... This will be a difficult battle.
Event_706503=You dare set foot in this place? You've underestimated our strength.¶All men! Attack!!! Pulverize the enemy!!
Event_706601=There's something ominous about this place. I wonder what enemies await us...
Event_706602=Come out, my soldiers!!¶On my honor as the Legion Commander, I swear I will destroy you!!
Event_706701=We guessed right.¶Datans are trying to mutate Demons in the camp.
Event_706702=Kainan! What are you doing here?!¶Are you trying to continue Woongpam's research?
Event_706703=Yes. We Dracans pursue strength.¶How we achieve it does not matter so much as what we get from it.¶Prince Woongpam's research should have continued.
Event_706704=I am afraid I will have to cut this meeting short, Stranger.
Event_706705=Kainan! You are clearly out of your mind.
Event_706706=Ha ha... Maybe so. But it doesn't matter.¶Die! Stranger!
Event_706707=Ah... you're so strong... No need to rush.¶We will meet again.
Event_706801=It keeps getting worse. High-rank Demons are blocking the way.
Event_706802=Nice to see you again.¶But you cannot pass through here.
Event_706803=We will see about that...
Event_706804=Ghaaaaa!!
Event_706901=I, impossible...¶But you don't stand a chance against this power!¶Prince Woongpam's research on temporary body mutation...¶I perfected it!
Event_706902=No... Kainan, why?
Event_706903=Ha ha ha... You showed up just in time. Chaisong.¶I will kill you and the Stranger!
Event_706904=Khmph! It's not over!
Event_706905=Hmmmph!! My head... It's splitting apart...¶Arrrrgh!
Event_706906=Phew... It's not too late.¶Let's see about lifting the mind control spell.
Event_706907=You will get back to your old self in no time.¶Who could have done this, anyway?¶Who has the power to subjugate the mind of the mighty Kainan?
Event_708301=Intruder detected. Eliminate.
Event_708302=The identification key does not work! Then it means...
Event_708401=Damn it, someone already took a massive amount of Pectra Energy!
Event_708801=You should have turned away while you still had chance. You are risking your life for nothing.
Event_708802=Do you really think I am the one whose life is in danger here?
Event_708803=You give yourself too much credit. Well, then I will have to do my best to make you see your error.
Event_708804=These are the top elites of the Dark Shadow. Hand-picked by myself. Well, let's see if they can make this fight more interesting.
Event_712101=Footprints of the Dukedom's soldiers.¶They were here not long ago, from the looks of it.¶Let's track these footprints.
Event_712102=Pondue...  Kali was right.
Event_712103=Who is it? A bunch of rats.¶Let's exterminate them!
Event_712104=You must have led those rats here.¶You turncoat... Wait while I kill the vermin. Then I will personally end your life.
Event_712105=S, sir knight! Please help us!
Event_712601=I never thought I would see you again... ¶I will repay the humiliation from our last battle!
Event_712602=Insolent fool...¶I cannot be killed by a mortal like you!
Event_712603=No... My gods...! What is this power?! ¶Lightbringer... But how?  Ghaaaa!!
Event_600501=Goblins wearing Santa Costumes took my horns. ¶Can you get my horns back before they get away?
Event_600502=Ah... They've already ran off!¶My horns!!! Get me my horns!!
Event_41001=You fools, how dare you try to intrude Pandemonium? Destroy this ship! Make sure it never flies again!
Event_41002=Sorry, but that's not going to happen.
Event_41003=That abominable voice... No... %s_9_1? Of course, there's no way I'd forget your voice.¶How could I? You killed Elyraq!
Event_41004=Kelbra? Did you do this?
Event_41005=Next time, I'll kill you!¶I'll avenge Elyraq!
Event_41006=Oh, no... But at least the airship looks unscathed. I'd better let those brothers, Durov and Duropan, know.
Event_20190801=March 11, 4:49 p.m. ¶The spores are spreading across the lab. ¶Aria is dying. Why would anyone...?
Event_20190802=March 11, 5:13 p.m. ¶Injected the sample serum in my body... ¶I have to save Aria... I can't die like this...
Event_20190803=March 11, 5:27 p.m. ¶I regained consciousness... My colleagues are mutating... ¶Aria's breathing is getting weaker... No... Nooooo!!!
Event_20190804=March 11, 5:41 p.m. ¶Intensive Cultivation Room. Injected the last sample into Aria. ¶Her heart is beating again... ¶Huh...? No, it can't be! No! Nooooo!!!
Event_715101=Ashas soldiers? Here? ¶Are they trying to make me pay for what I did earlier?
Event_715201=D... Demons everywhere... Pl... please... Help us! Somebody!!!
Event_715202=Everyone, stay close to me!¶Protect the children first. We can survive this!
Event_715203=No... It's not over yet!¶Don't let your guard down, everyone. There are too many of them!
Event_715204=What the...? What are they...?
Event_683001=Baraex. You think you're better than us?¶You seem to be quite sure of yourself.¶That research of yours is worthless! You're worthless!
Event_683002=What is your problem, Kunan?¶Baraex, let's get out of here.¶You don't deserve to be treated like this.
Event_683003=No... This isn't it! Nothing seems to work!¶What am I doing wrong? Should I try another combination?¶Or... Could it be that... I was wrong this whole time?
Event_683004=...Baraex... You're better than this.¶Cool your head, and start from the beginning.¶With your intelligence, I'm sure you will find a way.
Event_683005=Baraex...! It's... It's astounding.¶Oh... Baraex!! I knew you could do it.
Event_683006=Yes! Yesss! Finally!¶Gildan! Aria! Come here!¶We've done it!
Event_683007=I don't know what is about my behavior that displeased you...¶But I do apologize.
Event_684001=Grr... Aah... Grr..... Aah.....¶It hurts... Grr, hurts... Grr.....
Event_684002=Aah... Grr, hurts ... It hurts... Grr...¶Kyaaah !! Die... Grr., die !!
Event_684003=Aah... Gr... Pain... Grr......¶No... grrr, more... Thank... you...
Event_684004=Aria and I swore vengeance on the Ashas who abandoned us.¶You've denied us of that.¶I'll make every inch of your being suffer for that. Stranger...
Event_684005=Well, well... You killed that raging test subject, too?¶Resorting to brute force seems to work well for you...
Event_684006=I didn't want to get blood on my hands...¶But it looks like there's no other way...¶Now it's time for the present that I promised you...
Event_684007=You...!!!¶You must have been laughing behind my back all along.¶Well, you can laugh all you want. 'Cause it'll be your last laugh.
Event_684008=Kunan... Now I see what happened...¶You helped me and Aria get our vengeance.¶You... have my gratitude, stranger.
Event_684009=But... I will not rest until all Ashas are wiped out from this land.¶It is my quest, not yours. So leave this place at once,¶stranger!
Event_684010=I'm sorry, but I can't do that.¶The thing is, they went through quite a lot of trouble because of me.¶I've got to repay them somehow.
Event_684011=If that's your decision, then this will be your grave, stranger!¶And when I'm done with you, the streets will turn red with Ashas blood!
Event_684012=Forgive me... Aria...¶I ... failed you...
Event_684013=Kunan... You walk into your own grave!!!
Event_600701=When monsters reach the ladder,¶a pentacle appears for 10 seconds.¶Any monster remaining in the pentacle after 10 seconds¶will break through to the ground. Make sure none remain in the pentacle for too long.
Event_600702=If you're overwhelmed, activate the magiwater pipes around you¶to deal with the monsters!
Event_600703=Some powerful monsters are beginning to pour in.
Event_600704=There are some seriously bulky monsters approaching!
Event_600705=A giant monster approaches!¶Work together and defeat the monster!!!
Event_600706=Many monsters have broken through!!!
Event_600707=Too many monsters have broken through!¶You'll be overrun!!!
Event_716301=Damn you, Iris... â€śWear this badge,â€ť she said... â€śIt will protect you,â€ť she said...¶Well, I'll have to fight my way through to get to Guinness.
Event_716302=You have some nerve to come here after what happened at the Forbidden Archive...¶Or you want a quick death for yourself?
Event_716303=Not exactly. I am here to escort Princess Lunedill.¶It was you who decided to ignore the badge and attacked first.
Event_716304=Ah, is that so? Then, where is her highness?¶Am I the only one who doesn't see her? ¶Men! Kill this shameless vermin!
Event_716305=I'm sorry. It took longer than I thought.¶And you, you dare attack a bearer of this badge? Do you truly wish to die?
Event_716306=Damn it! You leave me no choice.¶We'll just say that the princess died in the chaos of battle.¶Don't let anyone survive!
Event_68801=Wait... What's this sound? Are they coming back already?¶We spent too much time looking for the seal.
Event_68802=Who do we have here? You are one brave soul to come here alone...¶I appreciate you giving me an easy excuse to end your life.¶Dark Shadows, kill that impudent wretch!
Event_60290=You dare steal a seal that represents your queen?¶Do you have a death wish?
Event_60291=Not at all, my queen.¶That knight was only doing my bidding. All the responsibility falls on me.
Event_60292=I don't know if word has reached you, my queen, but a group of Dark Shadows¶is pillaging villagers near the border. The reports are pouring in.
Event_60293=To look into the matter further, I instructed this knight to¶secure evidence of the ill deeds committed by Commander Guinness and his men.¶Also, Guinness tried to kill me and the knight at his home.
Event_60294=... Even if that were true, I cannot look over the fact that¶you plotted behind my back. You also entered the Forbidden Archive with a stolen seal.
Event_60295=You say you take full responsibility? Very well. Go to your chambers.¶You are not permitted to leave until you repent for what you have done.
Event_60296=Your grace knows no bounds, Your Majesty.¶I shall take my leave, then.
Event_68901=I knew it would be you.¶Stealing the queen's seal... You'll pay for this with your life!
Event_68902=You're faster than I thought. ¶But killing me won't be so easy.
Event_410101=Who knew there would be a facility like this?¶Incredible...
Event_410102=You came this far...¶Well, you might as well play with my children while you're here.
Event_410103=You're stronger than I thought.¶Let's play for a little longer, shall we?
Event_410104=You really are strong.¶Here come some more playmates...
Event_410105=Mm... How about these children?
Event_410106=Excellent!¶Now it's my turn.
Event_57301=Hah hah hah! Brother, your strength exceeds my expectations.¶I'm absolutely astounded that you defeated Death Roar on your own.
Event_57302=Hmph... You're amazing, being able to corner me like this.¶Thank the gods, I've got a contingency plan.
Event_57303=Thank the gods, I've got a contingency plan.
Event_57304=What the...!?
Event_57305=Ugh! Urrggh...!
Event_57201=My shoulders feel heavy from the burden of living for so long.¶Mortals like you can never know what's it's like to be forced to live for eternity.
Event_57202=Insignificant mortal,¶how dare you set foot in this place?
Event_57203=You're pretty annoying for a mortal!¶My creatures, break out of your eggs and feast on this prey!
Event_57204=You're not bad at all. And your power...¶Hm, first you must prove your worth to me.
Event_57205=Don't think this is over.¶Now I'll teach you the true meaning of fear.
Event_57206=Ah, perhaps you will be my undoing.¶Come, free me from my misery already!
Event_57207=Mother... I'm coming home...
Event_57208=Nothing's worse than being bound to a contract without end.¶I want you to know that you've been my salvation.
Event_600801=You're not allowed here! ¶ Leave before Master Lupa finds out!
Event_600802=You give me no choice! ¶I will obliterate you with my own hands!
Event_600803=Must... protect... Master Lupa... ¶Arghhh!!!
Event_600804=You walk to your own death, like a moss drawn to a flame. ¶ Soon, you will know the true meaning of terror. ¶Hwahahaha!
Event_67001=You came! I've been waiting for you. This is going to be exciting!
Event_67002=Which one should I pick? Not this one... Mm... Hm, this!¶Fight this guy!
Event_67003=Please don't disappoint me.
Event_67004=Oh! You're amazing! I'm seeing you in a totally new light.¶You're so much more than I expected. This is exciting!
Event_67005=Oh. You can't hear my heartbeat from that far away, can you?
Event_67006=I hate waiting!¶Come on up!
Event_67007=Come on, hurry up. It's not nice to make people wait.
Event_67008=Ah, this is too easy for you, isn't it?¶I should've prepared something tougher.
Event_67009=Right, right? This is too easy for you, isn't it?¶Next time, I'll be a bit more considerate!
Event_67010=Coming down here was worth the trouble. Come on up. Come on!
Event_67011=Well, you're not bad. Still not as good as I expected, though. Hm, maybe I should've given this more thought...
Event_67012=You're slow. Well, take your time. I can wait.
Event_67013=Terrible. There's nothing more to see. Even if there was, I wouldn't want to see it. Your journey ends here.
Event_67014=You're not too shabby. Now, come to me. Pick up the pace, will you?
Event_67015=I'm going to start raising the stakes now.¶Get ready!
Event_67016=Anilata! You've seen him, haven't you? I've created a likeness of him.¶I would've preferred that leader of the Crusaders if he weren't so full of himself.
Event_67017=I've created an Aveeter, too!¶He wasn't a bad sort. Well, except that he's too old-fashioned and boring. Now, play with him this time.
Event_67018=Ta-dah! Inus is my favorite! It rolls around like a ball, which makes it a good plaything.¶You can beat it too, can't you?
Event_67019=Now, warrior, let's see how you fare against my ultimate replica, Deosizer!¶¶...Yuck, so cheesy! I don't understand how anyone can utter such corny lines with a straight face!
Event_67020=Ooooh, how interesting!¶Let's see if you can really get to where I am.
Event_67021=Good, good. You're doing well. Show me what else you can handle. Don't let me down now.
Event_67022=Good job getting this far. You'll be here soon. Just hang on a bit longer!
Event_67023=Good, but it's still not impressive enough. You can do better, right?
Event_67024=I didn't expect anything less from you.¶Now, I'll let you come closer to me.
Event_67025=Now, I've prepared your next sparring partner. Are you excited?
Event_67026=This guy's a bit easy in my opinion, but you're not ready to fight anyone tougher right now.
Event_67027=Mm... I'd better find someone more suitable for you. You're not as strong as I thought.
Event_67028=You exceeded my expectations by coming here. Good job! You've earned some brownie points with me.¶Come on in. Open the gift I've prepared for you.
Event_67029=Not bad. I like you... a little bit.
Event_67030=I'm sorry, but... honestly, you're not as good as I thought. What a shame!
Event_67031=Welcome. Let's see if you're as good as I thought.
Event_67032=Slow down. No one's going to bite you.¶Ho ho ho!
Event_67033=So, you're good enough to handle this.¶I'd give you... 3 points.¶On what scale, you ask? Of 1 to 10,000, of course! Ho ho!
Event_67034=Great job. Now, who should be your next test?¶Hm... This one looks good.
Event_67035=A surprise challenge: how'd you like to beat Anilata within the time limit?¶Surprise challenges are fun, aren't they? No? It's okay, they are to me!
Event_67036=A surprise challenge: destroy Inus within the time limit.¶A race against time is always thrilling, isn't it? Just watching a race against time is exciting.
Event_67037=Give me a moment. I'll let him in.
Event_67038=Oh. How did this happen? It was just a mistake, right? You're not that weak, are you?¶Everyone messes up once in a while. Come on, try again.
Event_67039=Wahh?? Can't handle this, huh?¶Hm... But I haven't given up on you... yet.
Event_67040=Err... what's going on? Is this the best you can do?¶At least you want to try again. Good.
Event_67041=...You can try again if you want, but... I'm disappointed in you.
Event_67042=Sixth time!? This is not going to work. I think I misjudged you.
Event_67043=I'm disappointed in myself for overestimating you. You humiliated me.¶I'm going to finish you right here and now. You don't deserve any more chances.
Event_67044=Did I expect too much from you? I thought you were better than this. You look pathetic.
Event_67045=Interim check! Let's see how quickly you can get rid of your enemies. Use everything you've got!
Event_67046=Good job! You deserve my recognition!¶Very good! Show me more of your flashy moves!
Event_67047=Oooh, not bad! Not bad at all.¶I'll open a path for you. Hurry to me.
Event_67048=I'm a bit disappointed in you. I really am. Can't you try harder? Otherwise, this might end more quickly than you'd like.
Event_67049=It wasn't too difficult to get this far, was it?¶Be a little more patient.¶You want to see me before you leave, don't you?
Event_67050=You're almost there. Come on up. I'm waiting for you.
Event_67051=There you are! So, are you ready to play? This is going to be exciting!
Event_67052=Come on, the real fun hasn't even started yet! You're not tired already, are you?
Event_67053=Oh, where did the time go? Well, that was fun. I have to go, but let's do this again later, okay? See you!
Event_67054=Say, that warmed you up, didn't it? Then, let's get started.
Event_67055=Yes, yes. You've made some decent progress. Good job. I can sense that you're even closer now.
Event_67056=It's a pretty place, isn't it? But don't take too much time sightseeing. It's not nice to make people wait.
Event_67057=O-ho, that was pretty impressive. Better than I expected. Good job.
Event_67058=Do you still want to try again? You think you stand a chance? Just accept the reality.
Event_67059=Someone once said that without skill, one can only go so far by trying. That's the case with you.
Event_67060=...You must have been extremely lucky until now. I don't know what else to say. I'm just too disappointed.
Event_67061=Well, well. Maybe this challenge was too difficult for you. Oh well, I guess this is as far as you can go.
Event_67062=Oh no, I've prepared a nice gift, but I don't think you're ready to get it yet.¶Try to move more quickly next time, will you?
Event_67063=What you're doing is pointless. It's not going to change anything. You just keep losing.¶That simply won't change.
Event_67064=Poor and pathetic. You have no idea how terrible you are.¶An egg would have a better chance at breaking a rock than you do.
Event_67065=Hm, not bad. I'd better put a bit more effort into this, too.
Event_67066=Things started getting interesting. You're not going to quit now, are you? Come on, stay with me!
Event_67068=Looks like things are heating up. Good, good.
Event_67069=Come on, we've only just begun. Don't fall behind!
Event_67070=I have an eye for good warriors! Harder! Harder!
Event_67071=I didn't know you'd last this long. You're not bad. I like you!
Event_67072=Let's spice things up, shall we? A cold twister will sweep you up!
Event_67073=Alright, it's going to get colder now!¶What are you going to do this time? I'm looking forward to this!
Event_67101=You came! I've been waiting for you. This is going to be exciting!
Event_67102=Which one should I pick? Not this one... Mm... Hm, this!¶Fight this guy!
Event_67103=Don't let me down now.
Event_67104=Oh! You're amazing! I'm seeing you in a totally new light.¶You're so much more than I expected, it's exciting!
Event_67105=Oh. You can't hear my heartbeat from that far away, can you?
Event_67106=I hate waiting!¶Come on up!
Event_67107=Come on, hurry up. It's not nice to make people wait.
Event_67108=Ah, this is too easy for you, isn't it?¶Should've prepared something tougher.
Event_67109=Right, right? This is too easy for you, isn't it?¶Next time, I'll be a bit more considerate!
Event_67110=Coming down here was worth the trouble. Come on up. Come on!
Event_67111=Well, you're not bad. Not as good as I expected, though. Hm, maybe I should've given this more thought...
Event_67112=You're slow. Well, take your time. I can wait.
Event_67113=Terrible. There's nothing more to see. Even if there was, I wouldn't want to see it. Your journey ends here.
Event_67114=You're not too shabby. Now, come to me. Pick up the pace, will you?
Event_67115=I'm going to start raising the stakes now.¶Get ready!
Event_67116=Anilata! You've seen him, haven't you? I've created a likeness of him.¶I would've preferred that leader of the Crusaders if he weren't so full of himself.
Event_67117=I've created an Aveeter, too!¶He wasn't a bad sort. Well, except that he's too old-fashioned and boring. Now, play with him this time.
Event_67118=Ta-dah! Inus is my favorite! It rolls around like a ball, which makes it a good plaything.¶You can beat it too, can't you?
Event_67119=Now, warrior, let's see how you fare against my ultimate replica, Deosizer!¶¶...Yuck, so cheesy! I don't understand how anyone can utter such corny lines with a straight face!
Event_67120=Ooooh, how interesting!¶Let's see if you can really get to where I am.
Event_67121=Good, good. You're doing well. Show me what else you can handle. Don't let me down now.
Event_67122=Good job getting this far. You'll be here soon. Just hang on a bit longer!
Event_67123=Good, but it's still not impressive enough. You can do better, right?
Event_67124=I didn't expect anything less from you.¶Now, I'll let you come closer to me.
Event_67125=Now, I've prepared your next sparring partner. Are you excited?
Event_67126=This guy's a bit easy in my opinion, but you're not ready to fight anyone tougher right now.
Event_67127=Mm... I'd better find someone more suitable for you. You're not as strong as I thought.
Event_67128=You exceeded my expectations by coming here. Good job! You've earned some brownie points with me.¶Come on in. Open the gift I've prepared for you.
Event_67129=Not bad. I like you... a little bit.
Event_67130=I'm sorry, but... honestly, you're not as good as I thought. What a shame!
Event_67131=Welcome. Let's see if you're as good as I thought.
Event_67132=Slow down. No one's going to bite you.¶Ho ho ho!
Event_67133=So, you're good enough to do this.¶I'd give you... a 3.¶On what scale, you ask? 1 to 10,000, of course! Ho ho!
Event_67134=Great job. Now, who should be your next test?¶Hm... This one looks good.
Event_67135=A surprise challenge: how'd you like to beat Anilata within the time limit?¶Surprise challenges are fun, aren't they? No? It's okay, they are to me!
Event_67136=A surprise challenge: destroy Inus within the time limit.¶Racing against time is always thrilling, isn't it? Just watching a race against time is exciting.
Event_67137=Wait a second. I'll open a door for you.
Event_67138=Oh. How did this happen? It was just a mistake, right? You're not that weak, are you?¶Everyone messes up once in a while. Come on, try again.
Event_67139=Wahh?? Can't handle this, huh?¶Hm... But I haven't given up on you... yet.
Event_67140=Err... what's going on? Is this the best you can do?¶At least you want to try again. Good.
Event_67141=...You can try again if you want, but... I'm disappointed in you.
Event_67142=Sixth time!? This is not going to work. I think I misjudged you.
Event_67143=I'm disappointed in myself for overestimating you. You humiliated me.¶I'm going to finish you right here and now. You don't deserve any more chances.

Event_67162=Oh no, I've prepared a nice gift, but I don't think you're ready to get it yet.¶Try to move more quickly next time, will you?
Event_67163=What you're doing is pointless. It's not going to change anything. You just keep losing.¶That simply won't change.
Event_67164=Poor and pathetic. You have no idea how terrible you are.¶An egg would have a better chance at breaking a rock than you do.
Event_65101=Intruder!¶Dark Shadows, eliminate the intruder!
Event_65102=Kyaoooohhh! This darkness... encroaching upon my mind...!
Event_60091=Croak... Croak... CROAK...
Event_60092=Who...! *Croak*¶Dares!? *Croak* Interfere...? *Croak*¶With our singing!? *Croak*
Event_60093=*Croak... Croak...* I should've listened to Mom... *Croak...*
Event_601001=Are you the warrior from the MU continent?¶I can tell you have a special power.
Event_601002=But you still have to prove to me that you're worthy of my legacy.
Event_601003=The dragon is synonymous with the ordeals that one must overcome to be reborn as a hero. Prove your courage.
Event_601004=I've chosen you. Prove to me that I've made the right choice.
Event_601005=It's the duty of the strong to save as many people as they can, if they can't save everyone.
Event_601006=You must pass this test. You must prove that you're worthy of my power and legacy. No matter what.
Event_601007=Excellent. Now, one last test is waiting for you. Come.
Event_601008=Show me everything you've got. Prove that you're a hero who will bring hope and light to this world.
Event_601009=You'll undergo yet another trial. Prove that it wasn't a fluke that you've gotten this far.
Event_601010=You're far more capable than I thought! I'm elated.¶Now I have hope that maybe you can overcome all the trials I've prepared at once!
Event_601011=You deserve to carry on my legacy. I, Jian Manas, hereby approve of you.¶The light of Kantra will now become the light of MU and illuminate the whole world!
Event_601012=No! I can't lose my treasures.¶Please, I beg you. Please make those goblin thieves go away!
Event_59301=Ah, drat. What's going on? I can't move!¶You... You're...!
Event_59302=You fool. Just stay there until you realize how incompetent you are.
Event_59303=Quadro... What are you doing?¶*gags*..! Ah, argg!
Event_59304=The glory of the past shall be history.¶From now on, I will make new ones.
Event_59305=You were just a pawn in someone else's game. I'll let you live. Leave this kingdom while you can.
Event_59306=No... How can the chairman of the Senate do such a thing!
Event_732101=That's... Is that waterway connected to Qwahadan?¶If any poison gets into that water... *Shudder*
Event_732201=Everything has gone to hell... I hope they survived.
Event_601013=%s_9_1, I beg you, *Croak*¶Please save my friends from the gnolls and kobolds that have intruded Fabrice's Garden, *Croak!*
Event_601014=Good for nothing frogs...¶Get away! I'll deal with myself.
Event_601301=Ah... You found me. ¶You're just the Manager's watchdogs. Even this place is too good for you to die.
Event_601302=I can imagine my brethren screaming as you butchered them. ¶Their pain! Their sadness! I'll make you pay for all of them!
Event_601303=I won't... make any... mistakes... this time...
Event_601304=...Sorry, Brother...
Event_601305=Ah... I must protect... my... family! ¶E-Exterminator! I'll take your life, even if it kills me!
Event_601306=Please... Don't hurt my family... Aahh...
Event_601307=You ate my cat. Did you like it? ¶Yes... I'll burn you all! Slowly... and painfully!
Event_601308=Aahh... Beatrice... My poor cat...
Event_601309=My mission... isn't... over... yet... ¶I have to use... every last... ounce of my strength... to protect... my family...
Event_601310=I failed... this time. ¶But don't forget, I've got other selves in other places...
Event_601401=It looks like this is it for me.¶Know this, Exterminator: I may have failed this time, but I'll be back.
Event_601402=I may have failed this time...¶...but I won't next time...
Event_601403=I-I'm one and countless.¶You can't break my will, so long as one of my many selves remains.
Event_601404=My will has been passed down to me,¶and those that follow me will inherit that same will.
Event_601405=So, Manager, don't think you can change history the way you want.¶One day, we'll free history from your control.
Event_601406=We're one and countless. We're countless and one.¶We're the Liberators.
Event_601407=I can see...¶...the day our history will be freed from your control...
Event_601311=Oh, no! I'm too late... ¶Exterminator, I'll take your life, even if it kills me!
Event_601312=Watcher, the flame of hope is not extinguished yet. ¶You're alone, but we're countless. One day, we'll defeat you...
Event_58801=I haven't felt the pulse of such a pure, strong soul for a long time.¶Yes. You must be here to earn the right of the soul. Prove your worthiness.
Event_58802=I, Dragon King Kaizel, will test you myself.¶Challenger, I'll let you experience the true meaning of hardship.
Event_58803=Although only a small part of my soul reside here, it is still astonishing to be defeated...¶Excellent, I, Kaizel, acknowledge you.
Event_601201=This must be the Rift to the Hot Spring Egg Shop.¶I'd better remember this fox head crest if I want to drive away that legendary white fox.
Event_601501=Is this the Cherry Blossom Castle I've heard about? How beautiful!¶I'm sure Sekneum's followers are just here to enjoy the cherry blossoms, but the residents are terrified of them. I feel kind of bad for them, but they need to leave.
Event_420001=Welcome to this place! Just in time, I needed a lab rat! Muahahahaha!¶Kylops! Get them! Shred them!
Event_420002=Wooooo!! Wooooo!!
Event_420003=So, shall we proceed to the next step? I'm only beginning! How much more can you stand!
Event_420004=You do fairly well for a puny crawler. Can you take care of the remaining one? Can you?
Event_420005=Don't be too pleased with yourself! Soon, an unquenchable fear will visit you! Then, it will be your bodies that will shatter!
Event_19639=Customer appreciation festival! Come get 'em while you can! Sale extravaganza!
Event_19642=Hello! Hello! Hello! I've got some good items on sale. Come get them while you can! Thank you!
Event_19645=I've got a variety of items from the moon for sale.
Event_19648=I've got... a variety of items from my collections... on sale...
Event_19651=I've prepared some small, but useful supplies for you Guardians.¶Thank you so much for everything so far, and your continued support.
Event_19654=A pop quiz: who's the world's most generous Envoy? Me!
Event_19657=Sleepy... I want to sell these off fast, so I can go sleep... It's a holiday...
Event_59901=This scene is familiar. I'll have to be prepared for anything.
Event_60094=I've been through a lot of battles, but this is the most complicated, terrifying one.
Event_60095=I suppose that they are protected by a special power. We need something to break through that.
Event_60096=Clinging even after death, those vicious devildom bastards. Don't be fooled by their tricks.
Event_60097=Take care. Invisible, but there surely is something. We need a method to identify them.
Event_60098=I feel something from that device. Destroy it quickly, or there will be hell to pay!
Event_60099=Abyss never suited any place better. I know of your powers and reputation, but still be careful, %s_9_1.
Event_43011=*Growl*... more sheep to the slaughter! All right, let's have some fun!
Event_43012=You're fairly well for a puny crawler! But you will fall before this power in the end!
Event_43013=Oh, no! This cannot be my destiny! By such underlings!! I... I cannot!!!
Event_43021=This place is full of madness leading to death. Ordinary people who wander here will lose self and collapse.
Event_43022=To open the way here, we need to find another method. Look around with care.
Event_43023=A new way has opened. You're as good as they say.
Event_43024=It is impossible to fathom the threats of this place.
Event_43025=This is the typical view we imagine of devildom. It is terrible, scary, bizarre, cruel...
Event_43026=Some... terrible threat seems to be closing in. Get ready, %s_9_1!
Event_43027=It was really dangerous. It may be good to make repairs before going on.
Event_43028=I can't imagine how many died in vain in this place.
Event_43029=I feel a deep remorse from this strange stone statue. This... must have been made by demons to commemorate their slaughter.¶Please destroy all of them if possible.
Event_430210=It's true that I'm worried. Terrifying even, to think of what will happen if we fail..¶That's why we cannot give up.
Event_430211=Be ready for anything. Those with mighty force of darkness seems to appear soon.
Event_430212=If we fall, the world where our ancestors have lived, where we live in, and where our descendants will live will change.
Event_430213=The way onward has opened. But still we have a long way to go. Surely, we cannot fall down.
Event_43031=Welcome. It's an honor. Where would you prefer to be cut? Or, would you prefer to be burnt by electricity?
Event_43032=Your muscles and flesh is tougher than it looks. But no problem. I will shred it to pieces.
Event_43033=Ah, ahh... I so badly wanted to devour the soul, looking at the blood and guts falling pitifully...
Event_43034=Watch out. I sense the force of a terribly malicious being. It's a wonder for a soul to be infected with so much blood...
Event_602301=Welcome to carnival prohibition area tour! ¶This is a tourist course of a simplified prohibition.¶You can get killed if you get caught off guard, so please take care.
Event_602302=Now we will begin the tour.
Event_602303=The first attraction is the familiar flowers in the prohibition area. ¶Please head to the right and destroy the flowers and monsters.
Event_602304=Well done. ¶Now begins the main part.¶However, our carnival is not liable if you die.
Event_602305=The second course is defeating the swarming monsters. ¶Don't worry about the traps on the way.¶We've changed all of those.
Event_602306=The third course is taking a look around.¶You can just ignore and pass the room.¶You understand that the choice is yours?
Event_602307=We closed off the middle area because too many people get injured for unknown reasons.¶Too many flowers which is unusual, and there are also the sound of frogs... ¶Oh! You don't have to care about that.
Event_602308=Oh!!! There's the goblin!¶You have to get him before he gets away. ¶We're not responsible even if you lose him~
Event_602309=Our cutey, Koongbook. ¶For less repulsion, we've changed the name to turtle. ¶Since the attacking method is the same... Be careful.
Event_602310=The highlight of the prohibition area! It's the time attack. ¶We wanted to reproduce this place, but!¶Since it was really not necessary, we're just allowing you enough time for experience.
Event_602311=You have 30 seconds. ¶Better hurry up.
Event_602312=Congratulations! You made it.¶Wasn't it exciting when you heard the remaining time?¶I hope you had fun.
Event_602313=Great! You made it.¶Wasn't the time attack exciting?¶I think your heart is beating fast for joy.
Event_602314=The last of the tour is the berserk subject which has been taking care of your soul EXP for a long time.¶Please enjoy the tour until the end!
Event_602315=Congratulations!¶That is the end of the tour. ¶The exit has just been opened for you.
Event_602320=Crrrroaaak!! Who's killing all my flowers!!
Event_602321=It was you!~¶I will teach those of you who don't realize the value of flowers~
Event_602322=Croak... Croak..¶Now I have to move again because of you... ¶When will my dreams come true...
Event_602330=I'm just standing here because I was asked to. ¶I don't like flowers but I need the money...
Event_602323=You pushed through to here? Just as you guys have said.
Event_602324=Now you believe? I really mean it, conquered the carnival turtle in an instant!
Event_602325=Right. They conquered my berserk subject easily as well.
Event_602326=Karas! Finally found it. The test subject we were looking for...
Event_602327=Is that the knight you have been talking about?¶Very nice, as I was told. Would be a very good subject.¶You guys can leave now. I'll take him myself!
Event_601601=The door blocking the way has disappeared.
Event_601602=Probably not this way. ¶ I'll have to find another way.
Event_601603=Probably not this way. ¶ I'll have to find another way.
Event_601604=Probably not this way. ¶ I'll have to find another way.
Event_601605=Probably not this way. ¶ I'll have to find another way.
Event_601606=Long time! Can you help me when the situation here is sorted out? ¶It is a very urgent matter, I'll be at Ohrdor. I'm sorry but you'll have to visit me if you can help.
Event_601607=It seems urgent. I'll go to Ohrdor after I help the villagers.
Event_601901=I will test you to see if you're qualified to enter here!
Event_601902=Mwahaha, not too bad.
Event_601903=You've come here like that... pathetic. Then there is only death for you.
Event_56501=You really think you could stop me. Your efforts will be in vain, and turned to ashes!
Event_56502=I feel his force awakening. The force of him who gave me the true power of flame!
Event_56503=Foolish ones. Did you think that would matter at all. The results wouldn't change.
Event_56504=It is meaningless trying to stop my resurrection.¶What can you possibly achieve?
Event_56505=Do you hear the lava? It is like the roar of a beast which will soon devour all of you!
Event_56506=You're driving to your own death. It is impossible for puny mortals like you.
Event_56507=Hm... Still, you have good senses. However, the decided fall cannot be changed.
Event_56508=As I thought! You cannot escape my will! You will be gone!
Event_56509=You puny mortals cannot stand against me.¶I will give you the chance to turn back. That will extend your living days a little.
Event_56510=You were lucky to make it here. But my powers are not for you to stop!
Event_56511=Still running wildly.¶Foolish ones. It is your own death. Futile, at that!
Event_56601=So you will not go back. Then, the first sacrifice of my resurrection will be you!
Event_56602=Yes... I feel my strength coming back, just by thinking of burning you. A good kindling, I'd say.
Event_56603=You think that what you see is everything. Foolish, simple and lowly mortals.
