Occur_String6=¿Qué haces tú mientras tus guerreros por contrato se encargan de misiones tan peligrosas por ti?
Occur_String7=Se supone que el Ejército Real de Lorencia está a cargo de la defensa de la ciudad, pero nos ha dejado el problema de los mutantes a nosotros, la policía.<br>y contratamos a personas como tú para mantenernos vivos.

Occur_String5=Ella se está escondiendo en la parte sur del bosque, rodeada de sus guardianes.<br>Destruir los huevos de araña no funcionará mientras ella exista.
Occur_String6=Si puedes ayudarme, por favor extermina a la reina araña por mí.<br>No puedo dejar mi puesto, alguien tiene que vigilar a estos mutantes.

Occur_String2=La policía está ocupada luchando contra los mutantes.<br>Eliminé a una reina araña para ayudarlos.

Occur_String4=¿Qué te parecería trabajar para el Ejército Real de Lorencia en un contrato?<br>Recibimos a buenos guerreros como tú en cualquier momento.<br>También puedo pagarte mejor de lo que conseguirías en cualquier lugar de aquí.
Occur_String5=No me importa quién seas, siempre y cuando me pagues y pueda recuperar mis recuerdos.
Occur_String6=Sabes que este lugar es rico en mineral newk, ¿verdad?<br>Algunos nobles vienen aquí desde el continente para invertir en el mineral.
Occur_String7=Intenté advertirles sobre la situación en el Bosque Amberial, pero estaban decididos a hacer un recorrido por él.<br>Y, por supuesto, fueron mordidos por esas arañas mutantes.
Occur_String8=Necesitaba las patas de araña por su culpa.<br>El moco producido en las patas de araña es el único antídoto para su veneno.<br>Usa el moco para tratar a los nobles que están tirados en el suelo detrás de mí, ¿quieres?
Occur_String9=Cuando termines con los nobles, informa al comandante en la base del este.<br>Eso es todo.

Occur_String3=[Una nube oscurece su rostro mientras lee la carta.] ...<br>Lo siento, Jerome, pero yo tampoco sé la respuesta a esto.<br>De hecho, no creo que nadie sepa qué tiene en mente Rugard para nosotros...
Occur_String4=¿De qué se trata eso?
Occur_String5=Jerome es un devoto seguidor de Rugard, y su mente ha estado en un torbellino desde la invasión de Pandemonium.<br>No entiende por qué Rugard, el dios de la protección, no haría nada sobre la situación.
Occur_String6=¿Quiere saber por qué un dios no lo ayudaría? ¿Está en serio?<br>Hay muchas personas ahí afuera luchando por sobrevivir cada día. No voy a involucrarme en una farsa religiosa. Me voy.

Complete_String=El grupo de avance de los Larvas colocó explosivos en el lado sur de la base de la mina para hacer un agujero en la mina e invadir la ciudad de Dudrin a través del túnel de minería. Maté a los secuaces de Pandemonium que se interpusieron en mi camino y desactivé las bombas.

Occur_String3=No, están conectados a la mina Karmatan.<br>La mina de newk más grande de Dudrin en la Cuenca Weiss.
Occur_String4=¿Por qué querrían la mina en lugar de la ciudad de Dudrin?
Occur_String5=¡Lo tengo!<br>¡Es porque el newk es el recurso más importante de Dudrin!<br>¡Sin la mina Karmatan, la gente de Dudrin pasará hambre!
Occur_String6=En lugar de romper la defensa de Dudrin, están tratando de matarnos lentamente.<br>¡Pronto, el Ejército de Pandemonium vendrá arremetiendo a través de los túneles de la mina Karmatan!
Occur_String7=Por favor, ve a la Cuenca Weiss y advierte al Guardabosques Enano Kilry sobre esto.<br>Dirígete al sur, y puedes llegar al Puesto del Sur donde él está.

Occur_String3=Porque sabe que sin las minas de newk, Dudrin pasará hambre.
Occur_String4=Hmm... Esto tiene sentido.<br>El enemigo tendrá que arriesgar la vida de muchos soldados al atacar la ciudad de Dudrin. Está fortificada con gran fuerza.
Occur_String5=Mejor que informe esto al jefe.<br>Oye, ¿qué te parece trabajar para el Guardabosques Enano de forma contractual?<br>Te pagaré tanto como la Policía de Dudrin.

Completable_String1=Eres el Asesino Extraño, ¿verdad?<br>Mantenemos el oído en el suelo.
Complete_String=Kilry dijo que solo era un soldado. No podía dejar su puesto desatendido, pero el líder de su raza tenía que saber que la Cuenca Weiss era el verdadero objetivo del Ejército de Pandemonium. Me encontré con el Jefe Enano en nombre de Kilry y le conté sobre los planes del enemigo.

Occur_String6=No sabes cuántas acciones de la asociación tengoâ€”tienes razón, lo siento.<br>Bueno, um, ¿podrías pedirle al Comandante Leo refuerzos?
Occur_String7=Necesitamos ayuda de las fuerzas principales para rechazar al enemigo.<br>Es mejor que empiece a empacarâ€”no, disculpa, me necesitan en otro lugar.
Doing_String=Necesito cerrar mis cuentas bancarias y cancelar mi seguro. ¿Cuándo es el último vuelo a Lorencia?<br>*Jadeo* D-did you hear everything I just said?
Completable_String1=Ha pasado mucho tiempo, caballero. Pareces haber perdido peso.
Complete_String=El Jefe Enano estaba demasiado ocupado pensando en salir de la Cuenca Weiss antes de que atacara el Ejército de Pandemonium. La única esperanza que tenía era el Ejército de Lorencia. Me encontré con el Comandante del Ejército de Lorencia, Leo, para pedir ayuda en la defensa de la cuenca.

Occur_String3=Lo siento, pero estoy esperando el dirigible hacia el continente.<br>He informado sobre la situación aquí al continente varias veces, solo para ser ignorado por la nobleza.
Occur_String4=Ellos piensan que esto es solo una pequeña conmoción causada por los Demonios en el continente.<br>Regreso al continente para poder hablar con Su Majestad en persona.
Occur_String5=¿Y qué pasa con este lugar? No durará ni un día sin tu ejército.
Occur_String6=Mi llamado ejército consiste en un puñado de soldados. Este lugar necesita refuerzos del continente.
Occur_String7=Lo mejor que puedo hacer por este lugar es hablar con Su Majestad.<br>Resiste al enemigo el mayor tiempo posible hasta que lleguen los refuerzos.

Doing_String=.....
Completable_String1=Acabo de conocer al Comandante del Ejército de Lorencia.
Complete_String=Se negó a ayudar a defender la Cuenca Weiss porque pronto se irá a Lorencia. Dijo que hablaría con su rey y enviaría refuerzos, pero para mí sonó como si no quisiera luchar en una guerra perdida. Estoy preocupado de que Dudrin rápidamente caiga en el caos una vez que su ejército se vaya.

Occur_String4=El-puesto avanzado...<br>Cuando el enemigo ataque la Cuenca Weiss, su primer objetivo será el puesto.
Occur_String5=El arsenal en el puesto tiene armas que utiliza la Policía de Dudrin y la Guardia Enana.
Occur_String6=Dile a Kilry en el Puesto del Sur que lleve sus fuerzas al puesto avanzado<br>y lo proteja a toda costa.
Doing_String=Es valiente, pero demasiado terco para mi gusto.<br>No puedo obligarlo a hacer algo que no quiere hacer. Realmente es un arrogante.
Completable_String1=Bueno verte de nuevo. ¿Hablaste con mi jefe?<br>¿Qué dijo?
Complete_String=El Jefe Enano esperaba que el puesto avanzado fuera el primer lugar que atacara el Ejército de Pandemonium cuando llegara a la Cuenca Weiss porque alberga un arsenal compartido entre la Policía de Dudrin y la Guardia Enana. Fui a ver al Guardia Enano Kilry en el Puesto del Sur y le pedí que llevara sus fuerzas al puesto.

Occur_String3=No sabes de lo que hablas. Los abrigos hechos de piel de belbee se venden como pan caliente entre las noblewomen de Lorencia.<br>¡Están ganando mucho dinero!
Occur_String4=Cuando termines de recolectar pieles de belbee, llévalas a la Guardia Enana al norte de aquí.<br>Te pagarán tanto como quieras.

Complete_String=Un comerciante llamado Phili me pidió que recolectara pieles de belbee y las entregara a la Guardia Enana en el norte. Los belbees son bestias feroces nativas de la Cuenca Weiss, y su piel se usa popularmente para hacer ropa cara. Los belbees han mutado como todo lo demás en Enova. Pensé que Phili estaba loco, animando a la gente a matarlos por sus pieles. Apuesto a que mucha gente perdió la vida tratando de cazarlos. Entré en la guarida de las mortales bestias, preparándome para el mismo destino que mis predecesores, pero salí vivo, con la piel de la bestia en mis manos.

Occur_String1=Let's cut to the chase.<br>The Pandemonium Army isn't after Dudrin, but this place, Weiss Basin. Specifically, they're after the mines.<br>Because it knows that without the newk mines, Dudrin will starve.
Occur_String2=Not the capital city, but our mines?<br>That makes sense. The enemy will have to risk losing many soldiers by attacking Dudrin City.<br>It's fortified pretty strongly.
Occur_String3=The outpost will be the first place the Pandemonium Army hits.<br>Why don't you take everyone you have here and protect the outpost?
Occur_String4=I don't doubt it. The outpost holds the arsenal shared between the Dudrin Police and the Dwarf Guard.<br>But we can't move right now.
Occur_String5=The Evil Energy has reached the Weiss Basin, affecting the animals.<br>Mutant Belbees are killing people.
Occur_String6=Those beasts were ferocious before, but now they're totally out of control.<br>If we leave, we'll be leaving the miners at their mercy.

Occur_String10=Alright, when you're done culling them, head out to the arsenal in the north.<br>I'll gather everyone here and follow you.
Doing_String=Belbees are led by 3 females,<br>and they're called Queen Belbees.  Please be careful.
Completable_String1=I'm with the Dudrin Police. I came to support you<br>on behalf of Dwarf Guard Kilry at the Southern Post.
Complete_String=I suggested to Dwarf Guard Kilry at the Southern Post that we head out to the Outpost. Kilry refused, not wanting to leave the miners who worked near his post at the mercy of the ferocious belbees. He was being irrational, but I couldn't urge him to abandon the people he was supposed to protect. So, instead, I exterminated the leaders of the belbees for him.

Occur_String3=We fought tooth and nail.<br>There were twice as many of them as us, but we held our ground.
Occur_String4=Don't get me wrong, but maybe you didn't protect the Outpost. Maybe the enemy just wanted to mess with your arsenal.
Occur_String5=Even if it did, we've lost too much.<br>Half the soldiers at the Outpost are dead.
Occur_String6=Where are my manners?<br>I'm Ramotu Duprian, the Dwarf Guard Commander.
Occur_String7=Never mind. Shouldn't we put out the fire first?
Occur_String8=You're right. There are wells on the sides of this ruined village.<br>Could you draw water from them and use it to put out the fire at the arsenal?<br>We have to stay here, to keep watch.

Duprian, the Dwarf Guard Commander in charge of the outpost, said the Pandemonium Army left after setting the outpost's arsenal on fire,  which means the enemy specifically targeted the arsenal in the first place.

Occur_String3=Probably to the center of the basin. Every road in the Weiss Basin runs through the center.<br>They're trying to isolate us from the rest of Dudrin.

Completable_String1=Are you the commander of this post? Commander Duprian sent me.<br>I'm to help you fend off the Keru Legion.
Complete_String=Duprian thought the Kerus that burned down the arsenal would set up a camp in the center of the Weiss Basin. That way, they could block all the roads and keep reinforcements from Dudrin City at bay, while the main forces of Pandemonium attack the mines in the basin. I headed out to the Central Post to ambush the Kerus.

Complete_String=The Evil Energy has reached the Weiss Basin, turning the plants there into a horde of monsters, just like it did in the Amberial Forest. I chopped down a few Ents, the monstrous walking trees that roamed about the outpost, but unless the Evil Energy itself is destroyed, the plants of Enova will continue to mutate.

Occur_String2=Yeah, they're those slimy, disgusting-looking monsters. So they're the Goblins' livestock?
Occur_String3=The Goblins are demons of Pandemonium who were left behind on earth after the Three-year War.<br>They've formed a tribal state on the eastern edge of the Enova Continent.
Occur_String4=They've never invaded us before, but they stirred up commotion near the borders a few times.<br>The presence of Frog Beasts in the Weiss Basin means their owners, the Goblins, are here too.

Name=Goblin Battle Plans
Occur_String1=But there were too few of them.<br>There aren't enough of them here to call it an invasion...
Occur_String2=They have to be here for the Karmatan Mine, since it's the biggest producer of newk in this place,<br>but yes, you're right - there are too few of them.
Occur_String3=The Karmatan Mine is more secure than ever, now that Commander Duprian and his forces have joined its defending forces.<br>There has to be something else the Goblins want.
Occur_String4=I can go find out.
Occur_String5=Could you steal their battle plans from their camp?<br>That'll help us find out what they're up to.
Occur_String6=Ah, there's one problem:  neither of us speak the Goblin language.<br>Take their battle plans to Vigmund at the excavation site.<br>He should be able to read their language.
Doing_String=It'll take a while for us to regroup and attack the Kerus.<br>Neither the Dudrin Police nor the Dwarf Guard is a regular army - there's only so much we can do.<br>Those cowardly Lorencians, I can't believe they ran out on us in times like this!
Completable_String1=You're excavating artifacts in the middle of a war.<br>Are you crazy?
Complete_String=There were too few Goblins at the camp I raided. I thought they set up shop on the north side of the Weiss Basin to attack the Karmatan Mine, but those I found at the camp couldn't have taken on the mine on their own. I infiltrated their camp, stole their battle plans, and delivered them to Archaeologist Vigmund. He was the only one who could read the Goblin language and find out what the Goblins are up to.
List_String=(Enova Misión Principal) (34/48)<br>I should infiltrate the Goblin Camp and steal their battle plans to find out what they're up to.
Mission_String=Steal Goblins' battle plans and deliver them to Vigmund
Mission_Target1=Battle Plans

Name=Goblin Accessories
Occur_String1=I'm Volf, an alchemist. I sell jewelry in Dudrin.
Occur_String2=I came here to find some materials, and now I can't go back home because of the Goblins.  I guess I won't be selling jewelry for a while.
Occur_String3=By the way, I've noticed the Goblins are covered in the finest jewels from head to toe.<br>Do you mind grabbing a few jewels and bringing them to the Gemcutter at my shop?<br>I'll pay you handsomely.
Doing_String=Sigh, I don't like being stuck among all these soldiers.<br>I can't wait to go back home.
Completable_String1=Goblin accessories? Eww, they look so tacky!<br>No one wears anything like that anymore, but the gemstones themselves are beautiful.<br>Cut properly, they'll be worth a lot of money.
Complete_String=Alchemist Volf asked me for some Goblin accessories. His greed disgusted me, but he isn't the first one to take advantage of a wartime situation, and he won't be the last. I needed money to maintain my weapons anyway, so I killed Goblins, took their accessories, and delivered them to Volf's jeweler, Olivia.
List_String=I need to seize accessories from Goblin Workers/Guards/Archers, and deliver them to Jeweler Olivia.
Mission_String=Seize Goblin Earrings and deliver them to Olivia
Mission_Target1=Goblin Earrings

Name=Put Together the Battle Plans
Occur_String1=...I can be pretty stubborn when it comes to my job. By the way, who are you?
Occur_String2=A contract knight from the Western Post.<br>These are the Goblins' battle plans. I want you to read them for me.
Occur_String3=This is all torn up.<br>I'm Enova's best archaeologist, and I demand to be treated accordingly!
Occur_String4=They're not torn.<br>I think they were divided into three pieces on purpose to prevent theft.
Occur_String5=I don't care. Put them together.<br>I don't tolerate disrespect, especially if it's from my students!
Occur_String6=What? I'm not your student! Bah, whatever.<br>I'll put them together for you.
Doing_String=What are you doing?<br>Press the 'I' key to open your inventory.<br>And right-click on the Battle Plans to combine them into one.
Completable_String1=Crooked and barely held together by glue...<br>You may be a good fighter, but you're all thumbs when it comes to stuff like this.
Complete_String=That old arrogant coot, Archaeologist Vigmund, declared he wouldn't translate the Goblin battle plans unless I put together the three parts. I thought about breaking his neck and taking off, but I decided against it. Instead, I patiently glued each and every part together and gave the combined battle plans to the old coot.
List_String=(Enova Misión Principal) (35/48)<br>The Goblin battle plans are split into three parts for security. Put them together and give them to Archaeologist Vigmund.

[Quest_116]
Name=Stop the Attempt on Duprian's Life
Occur_String1=You're trying my patience. Stop yammering and start translating.
Occur_String2=All right, hmpf.<br>Um... "Dear Goblin warriors, it's time we get our revenge. Remember the humiliation we Demons were subjected to during the Three-year War?"
Occur_String3=Wait, just tell me what the Goblins want.<br>Are they really targeting the Karmatan Mine?
Occur_String4=Let me see. Mm...<br> "The objective of the detached forces is to escort Assassin Rosso to the north side of the basin."
Occur_String5=As soon as you arrive at your destination, set up camp and draw the enemy's attention. In the meantime, Rosso will infiltrate the Karmatan Mine and eliminate Dwarf Commander Duprian.
Occur_String6=...!<br>They weren't here for the Karmatan Mine - they're here for Duprian!
Occur_String7=Ramotu Duprian is literally and figuratively the actual leader of us Dwarves.<br>Without him, Dudrin is defenseless against the enemy's invasion!
Occur_String8=Did you say the assassin's name is Rosso?
Doing_String=It won't be difficult to find whoever that Rosso is.  According to some Three-year War documents, Goblin assassins are as big as mountains.<br>They're not stealthy, but they're strong enough to break their target's neck with just one hand.
Completable_String1=Mm, I'm glad you safely came all the way here.
Complete_String=That irritable old coot finally translated the Goblin battle plans, and what he discovered stunned both of us. There weren't many Goblins at their camp because they didn't come for the Karmatan Mine - they came to make an attempt on Duprian's life. I found and killed Goblin Assassin Rosso, whose name was mentioned in their battle plans, but these Goblins weren't the main forces; the main forces were somewhere else in the Weiss Basin. The situation is getting worse.
List_String=(Enova Misión Principal) (36/48)<br>I need to go to the Goblin Camp and kill Goblin Assassin Rosso who has been sent to kill Dwarf Guard Commander Duprian.

[Quest_117]
Name=A Goblin Follower
Occur_String1=H-help me, kind Knight!<br>I'm Felix, the greatest bard in all of Dudrin.
Occur_String2=What's a bard doing in the middle of a battlefield?
Occur_String3=Goblins may not look like it, but they are born romanticists.<br>Before they go out to fight, they inscribe war poems on stone slabs.<br>I came to see if their poems are as powerful and beautiful as people say, and then I got caught.
Occur_String4=They gave me a good beating, but didn't kill me. They said I don't look tasty enough.<br>Anyway, I haven't given up on my goal.
Occur_String5=Could you read their war poems and recite them for me?<br>I'll pay you handsomely.
Occur_String6=Aww, I'm still achy, but at least I can walk now.<br>I'm going to go take shelter in the Karmatan Mine. See you when you get there.
Doing_String=I swear, the Goblins are the world's greatest... oops! Never mind.
Completable_String1=Oh, wow! That's a wonderful poem!<br>"Goblins angry. Goblins kill. Humans, Dwarves.<br>Goblins hungry. Goblins eat Humans and Dwarves."<br>It's flawless! Aww, Goblins!
Completable_String2=(He's not a poet - he's a Goblin follower.<br>He's even wearing his hair like the Goblins do.<br>I'm afraid he's not the only Demon follower there is.)
Complete_String=I met a bard named Felix who was attacked by Goblins.  The Goblins beat him within an inch of his life, but that didn't discourage him from wanting to read their war poems inscribed on some stone slabs.  I read and recited Goblin war poems for him like he wanted.  I thought they were trash, but Felix couldn't stop praising them.  He was a Goblin follower.  The thought of many Demon followers like him made me feel bitter.
List_String=I need to read Goblin war poems inscribed on stone slabs and recite them for Bard Felix.

Occur_String1=Welcome. Thank you for taking care of the Goblin assassin,<br>who was sent to make an attempt on my life.
Occur_String2=Let's just say you're too valuable to die.<br>Anyway, I noticed some horned creatures on my way here.<br>Is there a ranch somewhere close or what?
Occur_String3=Oh, you mean the members of the Bull Horn Legion. They came through the Evil Energy.<br>Evil Energy has been created in many places in the Weiss Basin, so it's hard not to notice them.
Occur_String4=I've heard you failed to mend those tunnels in the Amberial Forest.<br>As long as the Evil Energy remains, the Demons of Pandemonium will come pouring through.
Occur_String5=Anyway, those Bull Horns are up to something.<br>They're hanging around the mine, but they haven't made a move.<br>Something's up. I can feel it in my bones.
Occur_String6=Let me handle it.<br>I'll check their majors and see if I can find anything.
Doing_String=As you know, only a small number of Goblins were sent to kill me.<br>Where are their main forces?
Completable_String1=I checked the enemy majors, but I didn't find anything suspicious.
Complete_String=I reunited with Dwarf Guard Commander Duprian at the Karmatan Mine. He thanked me for saving his life. I infiltrated the Bull Horn Legion's Camp, but I didn't find anything useful.

Name=A Trader in the Battlefield - 2
Occur_String1=I don't care if you're a knight, a trader, or whatever! ...Err, we meet again!
Occur_String2=You're the trader I met at the Western Post. You wanted me to skin Belbees for you.
Occur_String3=You're alive!? I thought you'd have been eaten by the Demons by now.
Occur_String4=What are you doing here?
Occur_String5=I go wherever a war takes place. Why? Because war equals money!<br>This time, I'm looking to buy Bull Horn Legion equipment.
Occur_String6=It's highly sought after by military collectors for its peculiar design.<br>Can you get it for me? I'll pay you well like the last time.
Doing_String=I don't care if you're a knight, a trader, or whatever!<br>Bring me Bull Horn Legion equipment! I'll pay you good money!
Completable_String1=Wow, you're as good as I remember. Have you thought about my proposition?<br>I mean, about working with me.

[Quest_120]
Name=Besieged Karmatan
Occur_String1=By the way, I've noticed something strange about their camp.<br>There are statues of a winged man in a black cloak here and there.
Occur_String2=The statues of Demus! They're the wardstones of Pandemonium.<br>Once a demon trap is created by them, no one can get past it.
Occur_String3=So they're trying to isolate us instead of wiping us out.<br>But why? I thought they wanted the newk mines, and Karmatan is the biggest one of all.
Occur_String4=We were wrong.<br>Get out of here before their trap is completed! <br>Go to Police Special Force Member Royce.
Occur_String5=He's hiding on the east side, watching the enemy's movement.<br>He's the best special forces member we've got. I'm sure he's found out something we can make use of.
Occur_String6=What about you? You'll be stuck here once the trap is completed.
Occur_String7=Don't worry about me. Just leave before it's done.<br>Come on!
Occur_String8=All right, but I'll try to get rid of as many wardstones as I can on my way out.<br>You can take care of the rest on your own.
Doing_String=Hurry! The enemy's trap will be completed soon.
Completable_String1=We meet again. Missed me?
Complete_String=The Pandemonium Army was trying to isolate Karmatan, instead of occupying it, by using its wardstones. Dwarf Guard Commander Duprian said once all the wardstones were in place, they would create a dark space trap, isolating the Karmatan Mine from the rest of the world. It means the enemy wasn't after the newk mines as we thought. After destroying the wardstones, I headed out to find Local Police Special Force Member Royce. He's Dudrin's best scout. He should be able to solve this puzzle.
List_String=(Enova Misión Principal) (38/48)<br>I have to destroy wardstones to stop the Karmatan Mine from being isolated, and tell Local Police Special Force Member Royce that the Pandemonium Army's target is not the Karmatan Mine.

Occur_String2=The Bull Horn Legion is trying to seal off the Karmatan Mine with its wardstones.
Occur_String3=It's trying to keep Duprian out of this war.<br>First, an assassination attempt, and now this. The enemy's afraid of Duprian.<br>He's a great commander and the greatest hero of the Dwarves.
Occur_String4=What are they up to?
Occur_String5=As far as I know, Bull Horn Colonel Ferocious has been sending big wagons south. I haven't found out what they're carrying, though.
Occur_String6=I will go check. Keep an eye out for me, will you?
Doing_String=I'm sorry I can't help you get your memories back,<br>but I promise I'll help you when this war is over.<br>I'm the best scout in the Dudrin Police, you know.
Completable_String1=Ah, you're back. What was in the wagons?

Doing_String=Please, let's go inside the mine... (Shudder)

Name=Zolatu Mining Association
Occur_String1=They're carrying people to the south.<br>Where do you think they're heading?
Occur_String2=Beats me. There's something that bothers me, though.<br>A while ago, a few Goblins broke into the safe in the Mining Association office,<br>and they only stole the blueprints of the mines.
Occur_String3=Check the officers at the Goblins' main camp.<br>They must carry the blueprints with them.
Doing_String=Why are we still here, you ask?<br>We built this mine.<br>We'd rather die than abandon it.
Completable_String1=I got this from the officers at the enemy's main camp.

Name=Goblins' Instigation
Occur_String1=The Zolatu Mining Association is a union of mine owners.<br>It's been instrumental to Dudrin's economic prosperity.
Occur_String2=You mean "your" economic prosperity.
Occur_String3=Hmpf, we employ thousands of miners. If the association goes down, then they all have to live out on the street.<br>And right now, it's in big trouble.
Occur_String4=I hear the Goblins are planning to distribute handouts that claim<br>the association is exploiting its miners.
Occur_String5=That's absurd, but it can still give ideas to some disgruntled miners.<br>Please seize their handouts and bring them to me. I'll pay you as much as you deserve.
Doing_String=Fifty years ago, Enova Continent was a useless, barren land. We at the Mining Association have built the newk mines and brought prosperity to this place.<br>But the Lorencians still treat us like a bunch of hillbillies...
Completable_String1=Did you bring them? Let me see.<br>"Dwarves exploit you.<br>We Goblins don't. We just eat you.<br>Dwarves surrender to Goblins."<br>Ba hah hah! This is stupid! I worried for nothing!
Complete_String=At the request of the secretary to the president of the Zolatu Mining Association, I seized the handouts that the Goblins had made to stir up the citizens of Dudrin.  The message was poorly written, but just the word of its existence was enough to cause panic among the members of the association, which proves they've been too greedy and they know it.

Occur_String2=Go to the Eastern Post. It keeps watch over the Heath Mine.<br>The guards there need to know what the Demons are up to.
Occur_String3=I'll do that. Thank you for everything. Bye.
Occur_String4=Wait! I'm a trader, and I don't get involved in any business unless I benefit.<br>What can you do for me in return?
Occur_String5=What do you want?
Occur_String6=I'm worried about the Goblins' main forces stationed here.<br>I want you to get rid of their chiefs.
Occur_String7=You've got enough soldiers to do that on your own.
Occur_String8=But they're just wandering mercenaries; they can't be trusted.<br>You owe me this.
Doing_String=I have everything except a private army.<br>I can easily find out where the Goblin chiefs are.
Completable_String1=Has there been a battle? This place is a mess.

Name=Goblin Collaborators
Occur_String1=You won't believe this!<br>Those ridiculous handouts from the Goblins actually worked!<br>Some weaselly miners have stolen newk from us for them.
Occur_String2=Are you sure it's because of the handouts, not because of your stinginess?<br>They could've stolen the newk because the Goblins promised them good money.
Occur_String3=That's beside the point.<br>What matters now is that someone dared steal the newk from us.
Occur_String4=Here's your new mission.  Take back the newk from the Goblin Camp and deliver it to Mining Expert Tobias at the Eastern Post.
Occur_String5=The shape of newk is unique to its source.<br>Tobias can tell from which mine the newk was stolen and help us narrow down our suspects.
Occur_String6=I think only fools would collaborate with Pandemonium in times like this.
Occur_String7=but your miners won't stop turning against you unless you start treating them better. Think about it.
Doing_String=Tobias is Enova's best mining expert,<br>adept at everything related to mining, from finding ore veins to mining them himself.<br>He's so valuable to us, so we've been keeping him safe at the Eastern Post since the war broke out.
Completable_String1=I'm from the Mining Association. Some miners handed over this newk to the Goblins.<br>Can you tell which mine it's from?
Completable_String2=Let's see... Too late.<br>It's polished already. They knew we'd try to trace it to its source.<br>I can't believe people are changing sides already.
Complete_String=Some miners stole newk and sold it to the Goblins. The association president's secretary asked me for help to hunt down the culprits. I took back the newk from the Goblin camp and brought it to Mining Expert Tobias, who could trace its unique shape to its origin and help us narrow down our suspects.

Occur_String5=Yes, and they were miners.
Occur_String6=(Why are they taking miners to that abandoned mine?)<br><br>How long has it been since they left here?
Occur_String7=An hour... You should be able to catch up with them pretty soon.
Doing_String=Watch out for the Mining Association president.<br>The mayor holds the office, but he holds the real power.<br>He has enough money to buy out the world.
Completable_String1=The miners were already taken to the mine. I didn't see any Goblins.<br>I only found this.

Completable_String1=I got rid of everyone I saw. You should be safe, at least for a while.<br>Stay alive, whatever it takes.
Complete_String=The guards at the Southern Post bravely fought against the Kunikulus Legion that had invaded the Heath Mine, but half of them had been killed and the rest were wallowing in guilt, shame, and fear of death. For them, I went to the Kunikulus camp and killed every enemy commander I saw. Without the commanders, the rest of the enemy wouldn't dare attack the Southern Post again.

Occur_String2=Ah, I'm sorry I didn't recognize you. "Enova's Hero," "Strange Slaughterer"...<br>You are known by many names. What brings you here?
Occur_String3=I've lost my memories. Could you help me get them back?<br>The harbor manager recommended you to me.
Occur_String4=Maybe. I'm rich enough to buy anything I want, including information.<br>What can you do for me in return? I'm a trader, not a charity worker.

Completable_String1=Pandemonium has invaded Duelden, just like it did Enova.

Completable_String3=How about I hire you as a special agent for my group?<br>First, please go to this city's administrator and assess the situations of my farms,<br>along with their damage statistics and countermeasures.
Complete_String=In exchange for his help with my lost memories, Ohrdor Group Chairman and Mayor Dumpain in Duelden asked me to check on his farms on the Bredrice Plains. I wasn't thrilled about going to Duelden, because it was under attack by Pandemonium, but it was a small price to pay to get my memories back.

Mission_String=Talk to Dumpain in Tempano City
Mission_Target1=Talk to Dumpain

Occur_String3=Once you go against his principles, it's just a matter of time before you disappear without a trace.
Doing_String=Dumpain has great ambitions.<br>*Whisper* So many people have been affected by his ambitions...

Occur_String1=Knight, please help me if you have some time.
Occur_String2=Everyone's ignoring me because I'm from the countryside.<br>I'm sure they will be surprised by my items...<br>These are the things that city folk haven't even seen before.
Occur_String3=Could you take my items and sell them to the Ohrdor merchants?<br>Once they see my masterpieces, they will fall in love with them...<br>Please do me a favor.
Doing_String=You shouldn't underestimate country people like me.<br>They are sometimes better at things than the city folk...
Completable_String1=Where did you get this? It's not something you can find in Ohrdor...<br>And the quality is great.
Complete_String=I collected the country merchant's items and delivered them to the Ohrdor merchant. Seeing the reactions of the Ohrdor merchant, it looks like the country merchant wasn't bluffing.

Occur_String3=Ohrdor is a commercial metropolis where lots of trade goods are made and exported to various places around the world.<br>And this great city belongs to Dumpain.
Occur_String4=I'm in charge of trade in Ohrdor.<br>Speaking of which, could you help me collect trade goods from the Ohrdor merchants?
Occur_String5=It's a big city so it's hard for me to go around by myself.<br>I'm counting on you!
Doing_String=Everything from this giant airship to that little clump of grass belongs to Dumpain.<br>I wonder what it would feel like to be that rich...
Completable_String1=Thanks. Stranger!<br>You work so fast, you could probably follow in my footsteps and become a trader as well!

Occur_String2=Knight, if you are on an adventure, aren't you curious about Ohrdor?<br>Could you go around the city and investigate what's going on?
Occur_String3=If you look in every nook and cranny, I'm sure you'll find out what is causing this mysterious energy.<br>I'm busy with other stuff, you see. I do hope you can help.
Doing_String=We are a privately funded security unit, and we are a different race from the Arkeans here in Ohrdor.
Completable_String1=I went around like you asked me to, and found some people of an interesting-looking race.<br>They said a few things, but I didn't feel threatened by them.

Occur_String2=If I give out the wrong amount of supplies, I will be in a big trouble...<br>Could you please go inside the Ohrdor trade airship and retrieve the supplies that were loaded up by my mistake?
Occur_String3=I'm too busy checking other lists...
Occur_String4=You should've been more careful... *Sigh* Fine.

Name=Bounty Hunter
Occur_String1=Hey, are you interested in becoming a bounty hunter? Don't you want to make some good money?<br>If you have enough stamina and patience, that is.
Occur_String2=We have a new list of most wanted criminals. It's the Arke Pirates.<br>They infiltrate trade airships all over the continent and steal the merchants' goods. They are very vicious pirates.
Occur_String3=The Arkeans are well known for their commercial skills, but apparently these pirates are a bunch of Arkeans who don't have that ability.
Occur_String4=A lot of merchants around the continent are complaining about those pirates.<br>So, are you interested? If you are interested, go search the airships in Ohrdor.<br>And if you find them, bring back the marks of the Arke Pirates as proof.

Occur_String2=My master doesn't entrust just anyone with a task.<br>But he might think you are different.

Name=Creating Tournament Raid Team
Occur_String1=Finally, the guidelines for the Tournament raid teams have been announced!<br>Join the Tournament and compete against other guilds for territory, glory, and fame!<br>Pit your swordsmanship and magic against others!
Occur_String2=This tournament is not a bar fight. It follows strict rules.<br>All participating guilds are required to elect a raid leader, create a raid team, and compete in matches at certain times.
Occur_String3=If you want more details, Durendal and Gladius in Guild Harbor can help you.<br>They are there to help guilds create and dispatch their raid teams.
Doing_String=Err? Why are you still here? Guild Harbor is southwest from here.
Completable_String1=I'm here about the guild raid team.<br>I was told you could help me create one.
Completable_String2=Welcome. I can tell you've faced more than your fair share of challenges.<br>Any guild is lucky to have seasoned warriors like you.
Completable_String3=The raid team is the representative of its guild in the Tournament.<br>Only guild leaders can apply to create one in the Tournament week.
Completable_String4=If your guild's application is accepted, then it'll be given time to create a raid team.<br>Only the raid leaderâ€”usually the guild leader themselves<br>or someone they appointedâ€”can create a raid team.
Completable_String5=Once a raid team is created, you can recruit members for your matches and get ready to dispatch the team.<br>When the Tournament begins, all the raid teams set sail for their matches, which is a sight to behold!
Completable_String6=That's all there is to know about creating a raid team.<br>It may sound complicated, but just try once or twice. You'll get the hang of it.
Complete_String=Durendal told me how to create the raid team. My guild leader first has to apply for the Tournament, and then my raid leader can create a raid team, recruit members, and get ready to dispatch the team.
List_String=I'm interested in the guild raid team. I should go talk to Durendal, who's in Guild Harbor helping guilds create it.
Mission_String=I must listen and learn how to create the guild raid team.
Mission_Target1=Talk to Durendal

[Quest_226]
Name=Dispatching Tournament Raid Team
Occur_String1=Once I create a raid team, then what?<br>Didn't you say I have to join the Tournament?
Occur_String2=Yes. Even if you create a raid team, it'll be no good if you don't depart for your match.<br>Talk to Gladius next to me.<br>He can tell you all about it.
Doing_String=Go to Gladius. He can tell you about how to dispatch your team for the Tournament.
Completable_String1=Seeing that you came to me after talking to Durendal, I assume you want to know about the guild raid team.<br>I can tell you about how to dispatch your team for your Tournament matches.
Completable_String2=Raid teams can be dispatched for their matches in 5 minutes before the Tournament begins.<br>Of course, everyone in your raid team, including its leader, must be present to do that.
Completable_String3=When all the members are ready, then the raid leader can come to me and announce your dispatch.<br>Your raid team will then depart for the battleground.<br>Whatever happens next depends on you and your members.
Completable_String4=The dispatch process itself is simple enough, but there's something you must remember:<br>you cannot dispatch the team once the Tournament begins. You'll be automatically disqualified.<br>And you'll have to wait for another Tournament.
Completable_String5=You're saying I've got only 5 minutes to announce my readiness for dispatch? That's not enough time.
Completable_String6=This tournament is not a street brawl. A lot is at stake for the participating guilds.<br>This time restriction is necessary to filter out those who don't deserve to be in the competition.
Completable_String7=This is called the Trophy Coin. You can donate it to your guild and increase your Guild Trophies, which are required for joining the Tournament.<br>It's valuable. Use it to join the Tournament later.<br>Now, I'll see you when the Tournament begins.
Complete_String=Gladius told me how to dispatch the team for the Tournament. Raid teams must be dispatched within a certain period of time, and those who don't will be disqualified when the Tournament begins.
List_String=I want to know how to dispatch the raid team. I should go talk to Gladius, who's in Guild Harbor helping guilds do that.
Mission_String=I must listen and learn how to dispatch the guild raid team.
Mission_Target1=Talk to Gladius

[Quest_230]
Name=A Call from Guild Harbor
Occur_String1=I thought you looked amazing when you defeated Glasha. You look even more so now. As the manager of the harbor, I hear news more quickly than anyone else. You're famous in Enova, Duelden, Litenberg, and even Noria. You're the hero of the century.<br>So, have you found some of your memories?
Occur_String2=Not yet.
Occur_String3=*Sigh...* I told you, you should forget about it and settle down here. Just enjoy your fame and wealth for the rest of your life. Tsk, tsk. You're asking for trouble.
Occur_String4=Anyway, good news for you: Guild Harbor is looking for strong, reliable contract knights, and I can't think of anyone who's more qualified than you.
Occur_String5=What's happening there?
Occur_String6=I don't know exactly, but word is that a special airship is being built right now.
Occur_String7=You're a habor manager. You should know what's happening in the harbor better than anyone else.
Occur_String8=You're right, but Guild Harbor is special. It's... extraterritorial, if you will. I can't help it: that place is teeming with all kinds of organizations, armies, and knights.<br>Officially, Guild Harbor is also under my control, but that actually doesn't mean much.
Occur_String9=Anyway, if you're interested, go to Duropan and Durov, the airship maker brothers at Guild Harbor.
Doing_String=Duropan and Durov are looking for competent contract knights. They would love to hire you.
Completable_String1=This place is off limits! Get out of here now, or else!
Completable_String2=Harbor Manager Lise referred you to me and mentioned you need help.
Completable_String3=Oh, are you a contract knight? I'm sorry for acting so rude. So, what's your name?
Completable_String4=%s_9_1.
Completable_String5=%s_9_1? %s_9_1... Why does that sound familiar? Hey, Durov! Have you heard this name, %s_9_1?
Completable_String6=You jerk, how many times do I have to tell you to call me Brother?
Completable_String7=Whatever. I said, have you heard of %s_9_1?
Completable_String8=Did you just say, Whatever? Grr, you...!<br>Anyway, %s_9_1? That's the name of a famous contract knight. Wait, are you that knight?<br>Wow, Lise is not as incompetent as I thought. He's sent us a major player!
Complete_String=I came to see Durov and Duropan, the brothers whom Lise had referred to me. I was told they make special airships. My first impression of them was that they were loud.
List_String=Lise has introduced me to Durov and Duropan, who are making a special airship at Guild Harbor. Let's go to them.
Mission_String=I have to meet Durov and Duropan, the brothers whom Lise has referred to me.
Mission_Target1=Talk to Duropan

[Quest_231]
Name=The Brothers' Request
Occur_String1=Well, you went to town on the Demons. I think I can tell you what we're doing.<br>This airship we're building is designed specifically for expeditions into Pandemonium. The plan is to establish a route to that realm, you know.
Occur_String2=We can go to Pandemonium? Are you serious?
Occur_String3=Yes. We can't always be the ones being invaded. We're working with the Rift Research Society to build this airship and invade Pandemonium back.<br>I'm charged with the development of her engine, which we call the Odyssey Reactor.
Occur_String4=And I'm charged with the development of her hull. Building it is no easy feat.<br>I have to make sure it can withstand that ridiculously powerful engine's output and the warping of spacetime it causes, not to mention the Evil Energy that permeates Pandemonium.
Occur_String5=No matter what you say, this airship is nothing without my engine. We're not spending a fortune on making a sailboat, now are we?<br>What do you think you could do without my engine? Well, I guess you could take her for a picnic to the mountain near some village or go for a cruise out at sea.
Occur_String6=So I'm telling you, do something about that beastly engine of yours! It weighs too much, and it costs too much fuel! We're being funded because we're doing this for the greater good, but we also need to heed our conscience. This is not an engineâ€”it's a bottomless pit!
Occur_String7=You should lighten her hull instead! My engine costs a lot of fuel because it has to travel through spacetime! Besides, what about all the warriors and supplies that the ship has to carry? Her engine has to be strong enough to do it! Where are you spending all the funds we're getting? On stuffing yourself with food?
Occur_String8=Oh geez, I can't talk to you! If you weren't my brother, you would've been fired a long time ago, do you know that?
Occur_String9=If I wasn't your brother? Are you kidding me? You've never treated me like your brother!
Occur_String10=.....
Completable_String1=So, what can I do for you? Watching you guys fight is fun, though.
Completable_String2=*Ahem* Then, help me first. To run this engine, I need a tremendous amount of energy from the Riftâ€”
Completable_String3=Forget that. I need help more than you do because your engine keeps warping the hull. To prevent that, I need something from Lupa's Labyrinthâ€”
Completable_String4=Argh, are you really going to do this? We have to finish the engine first!
Completable_String5=The hull first!
Completable_String6=*Sigh.* You don't have to stand in line. Both of you, just tell me what you need. I'll bring it as soon as I can.
Complete_String=Watching the brothers, Durov and Duropan, fight, I can't help but admire their parents, whom I've never met. How did they manage to raise these two?
List_String=It's a given that siblings bicker, but I don't think I've ever seen any argue as much as these brothers. By the way, what do they want me to do?
Mission_String=Ask the brothers what they need
Mission_Target1=Talk to Durov

[Quest_232]
Name=Test-run the Odyssey Reactor
Occur_String1=The Odyssey Reactor is completed as far as the construction goes, but I haven't given it a test run. Moving this gigantic engine, even for a test run, requires a tremendous amount of energy.
Occur_String2=The Rift Research Society guys said that you were practically immune to the Rift energy. Is that true? Then, could you bring me some Rift Crystals for the engine's test run?<br>I've heard you can find them from the monsters that have been stranded where the Rift Warp has been most severe for a long time. What are they called? Elite? I think that's it, Elite or higher-grade monsters.
Occur_String3=How many do you need?
Occur_String4=Three should be enough to give the engine a full test. Thank you for doing this.
Doing_String=How much longer do you think you need to get three Rift Crystals? I'll appreciate it if you can hurry up.
Completable_String1=Wow, good job! You brought them so quickly. You're as good as people say you are. Thank you!<br>Now, then I'd better get to work.
Complete_String=Durov wanted Rift Crystals that could be found from the Elite or higher-grade monsters that have wandered in Rifts for a long time. As soon as I gave him the Rift Crystals, Durov started preparing a test run of the Odyssey Reactor.
List_String=I should eliminate Elite or higher-grade monsters in Rifts and collect Rift Crystals for Durov, so he can conduct a test run of the Odyssey Reactor.
Mission_String=Collect items for Durov from Elite or higher-grade monsters in Rifts
Mission_Target1=Rift Crystal

[Quest_233]
Name=Turning Point of the Hull Construction
Occur_String1=I have to reinforce her hull to support that dratted engine. The problem is that it's next to impossible to find a substance that can withstand the engine's output and the Evil Energy at the same time. Seriously, I've tried every single substance available on Earth.
Occur_String2=Now I have to look elsewhere. What I want right now is the equipment and bodily constituents of the most formidable enemies in Lupa's Labyrinth.<br>The fact that they retain their shapes in such a warped environment proves that they're what I need.
Occur_String3=I've heard you can adjust the difficulty level of Lupa's Labyrinth by winding the clockwork in there. According to my calculations, for the hull to withstand the engine's output, it has to be made of materials from creatures that are at least Level 50.<br>I don't need a lot; I just need 2. Do you think you can get them for me?
Occur_String4=I don't see why I can't. I'll bring anything I find useful in the Labyrinth.
Doing_String=This is all because of the engine. Then again, even I know improving the engine isn't easy...<br>Ah, don't tell Durov I said this. I don't want it going to his head.
Completable_String1=Wow, this is better than I expected. I can tell just by looking at this that it'll make the perfect hull!<br>Alright, I'm ready to research again!
Complete_String=Duropan wanted the weapons or bodily constituents of the most formidable enemies in Lupa's Labyrinth where spacetime is warped. I brought them to him, and he immediately started improving the airship's hull.
List_String=I must get the weapons or bodily constituents of the most formidable enemies in Lupa's Labyrinth, so Duropan can improve the airship's hull with them.
Mission_String=Eliminate Rift Predators in Level 50 Lupa's Labyrinth and collect items for Duropan
Mission_Target1=Material Forged in Spacetime

Name=Anxious Eyes
Completable_String1=Do you have something to say to me?
Completable_String2=Oh... Well... It's... I-I'm not a suspicious person! I'm just... I'm Barbara.
Completable_String3=Calm down. You look like you have something to do with this airship. Are you one of the makers?
Completable_String4=Huh? Oh, yes. That's right. I'm Barbara, one of the airship researchers. By the way, are you %s_9_1? I've heard Lise has referred that knight to us.
Completable_String5=I am.
Completable_String6=Then, could you help me? Please take a look at this memo. Um, do you recognize this writing at all?
Complete_String=The female researcher who was timidly glancing at me introduces herself as Barbara and asks for my help. Judging by the anxious look in her eyes and her nervous behavior, something serious must have happened to her.
List_String=After helping Duropan and Durov, I came outside the Airship Dockyard and had the feeling that someone was watching me. I think it was that female researcher over there. I'd better go talk to her.
Mission_String=Talk to the person who was watching you
Mission_Target1=Talk to Barbara

Occur_String2=I picked it up while working. I've never seen writing so this before, so I checked. I couldn't find any references.<br>Then, suddenly it came to my mind that they might be related to Pandemonium...
Occur_String3=You're worried because you can't find any information about that language.<br>Sorry, but I don't know what they mean either.
Occur_String4=I see...
Occur_String5=But I've seen similar-looking letters imprinted on the swords and armor that the Demons use.
Occur_String6=Oh, gods! Then, is it possible this can be a Demon language?
Occur_String7=I'm not sure, but it's highly likely.<br>Could you give me the memo? I'll look into it.
Doing_String=I thought it might, but it really could be a language of the Demons. How terrifying!
Completable_String1=%s_9_1! What kind of interesting case do you have this time?
Completable_String2=What I've got this time is not interesting at all.<br>Take a look at this memo. A researcher named Barbara, who works at the Airship Dockyard, picked this up.
Completable_String3=Ooh, is it written in code? I'm the expert when it comes toâ€”<br>...<br>You're right. This isn't interesting at all. You've got this memo from the Airship Dockyard?
Complete_String=Kundun's face hardens as he examines the memo I gave him. So it's not a prank.
List_String=Deliver Barbara's memo to Kundun and ask him in what language it's written. I hope I'm wrong...
Mission_String=Check the language and content of Barbara's memo
Mission_Target1=Talk to Kundun

[Quest_236]
Name=The Airship in Crisis
Occur_String1=When I fought the Demons, I think I saw similar-looking letters on their weapons and armor.
Occur_String2=You saw correctly. This is a language used by Demons. A researcher at the Airship Dockyard found this, which means there's a mole among us.<br>The success of this airship affects the future of the MU Continent. We must find the spy.
Occur_String3=Okay, but what does it say on the memo?
Occur_String4=Hm... But the way this is written is different from the way that the most Demons write. I'm having a hard time translating it. Give me a moment...
Occur_String5=...<br>Go back to the Airship Dockyard right now! That place is in danger! The Demons are planning to attack it!
Occur_String6=Drat! Why are my bad premonitions never wrong?
Doing_String=I'll look further into this memo. There might be something else that's important.
Complete_String=I entered the Airship Dockyard. It was already infiltrated by the Demons who wanted to destroy the airship. Drat, I'll have to fight now.
List_String=The Demons have invaded the supposedly most secure place in Ohrdor, Guild Harbor. I'd better head to the Airship Dockyard there right away.
Mission_String=Stop the Demons from attacking the Airship Dockyard
Mission_Target1=Enter the Airship Dockyard

[Quest_237]
Name=Stop the Demon invaders
Complete_String=Kelbra was behind the Demon attack. She's been on the loose since she took off with Neria's Tears. Has she been planning this all along?
List_String=I must stop the Demon invaders. I can't let them destroy the airship.
Mission_String=Stop the Demons from destroying the airship
Mission_Target1=Eliminate Demon invaders
Mission_Target2=Subdue Kelbra

[Quest_238]
Name=Barbara's Wit
Occur_String1=Oh, gods! Who knew we'd be attacked by the Demons? How did this happen?
Occur_String2=There has to be a mole among us. Who is it? Who's shameless enough to sell his country and the rest of Earth?
Occur_String3=We must find him. We must follow him if he has run. Yes, that's right. If he's dead, we must dig him out of the grave. What a scumbag! He's betrayed his own kind for the Demons!
Occur_String4=By the way, %s_9_1, thanks to you, the airship is safe. I haven't given her a thorough examination, though.
Occur_String5=Thank you, %s_9_1. How did you know the Demons would attack? Do you also have the ability to see the future?
Doing_String=I'm glad the airship is safe.
Completable_String1=No, I don't have that kind of ability. Thank Barbara. This place would've been in shambles by now if it weren't for her.
Completable_String2=Huh? Barbara?<br>(Looking at Barbara) Barbara, what happened?
Completable_String3=I found a strange memo, and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't figure out what language is was.<br>At this workshop, we're building an airship to fight Pandemonium. I didn't think finding such a suspicious memo in such an important facility was a good sign. Then, I saw %s_9_1 come by, so I asked for help.
Completable_String4=Why didn't you ask us firstâ€”<br>No. Duropan and I have been so busy making the airship that even if you showed it to us, we probably would've brushed it off and forgotten about it.<br>And if we did... *Shudder* I don't even want to think about it.<br>Good job, Barbara.
Completable_String5=Yes, good job, Barbara! You saved this airshipâ€”all of us!
Completable_String6=I only used my strength. Ultimately, it was your curiosity and wit that stopped a disaster.
Completable_String7=I know, right? You guys can't do anything without me. Where would you find another researcher who's as competent as I am?<br>My idea for improving the Odyssey Reactor's output last time helped, didn't it? And I told you to change to that material to lighten the hull, and it worked too, didn't it?
Complete_String=Excited by the praise, Barbara became cheerful all of a sudden. She must like being praised. She really deserves it this time.
List_String=I'm glad I stopped the Demons before it was too late, but I'm not the hero this time; Barbara is. If she didn't tell me about the memo, even I wouldn't have been able to stop them in time.
Mission_String=Tell others about what Barbara did
Mission_Target1=Talk to Barbara

[Quest_239]
Name=A Sudden Entrance
Occur_String1=Uh-oh. She's getting hyped up again.<br>It's true that she saved the day, but this is going to keep her overly excited for at least a week. Ooh, I don't want that.
Occur_String2=A week? It'll last for at least a month.<br>Anyway, thank you, %s_9_1. We couldn't have improved the airship or protected it against the enemy attack if it weren't for you.
Occur_String3=I'm glad to be of help. I'd better go now. I know the Demon who's responsible for this attack. I haven't seen her since Litenberg. I want to know why she's shown up all of a sudden.
Doing_String=Thank you, %s_9_1. Come by when you're not busy. I'll buy you a drink.
Completable_String1=You came back safely. You're as strong as I thought. By the way, did Kelbra show up there?
Completable_String2=Yes. She was responsible for this raid. Was her name in that memo?
Completable_String3=No, but the way it was written was different from the way that the most Demons write. It also contains words that the Demons rarely use.<br>Then, I thought, Kelbra would write like this.
Completable_String4=I've seen Chaisong in anguish several times because of her betrayal. He thinks that it's his fault that she wasn't raised right. I feel sorry for him.
Completable_String5=Kelbra was a human once. She knows us better than other Demons.<br>This won't be the last time she'll try to deceive us.
Completable_String6=You're right. I'd better tighten security and see if anyone has seen or met any suspicious individuals lately.
Complete_String=So far, the Demons carried out their schemes in secret, and then launched an all-out war in the end. But this attack orchestrated by Kelbra was different, and perhaps even more dangerous. I'd better watch out for her.
List_String=The incident at the Airship Dockyard was resolved, but I'm still surprised by Kelbra's sudden reappearance. Did Kundun find anything? I'd better go back to him.
Mission_String=Talk to Kundun about Kelbra's reappearance
Mission_Target1=Talk to Kundun

[Quest_240]
Name=The Patron of the Airship
Occur_String1=Now that the situation is pretty much settled, I want you to let Dumpain know. You took care of it; it's best you talk to him.
Occur_String2=Dumpain? What for?
Occur_String3=He's the biggest patron of this airship project. If it weren't for Ohrdor Group's money, we'd never dreamed of making our way into Pandemonium.<br>He's got so much money that he could build dozens of gigantic airships like this if he wants.
Occur_String4=Hm, what's that money-monger up to this time?
Doing_String=I don't know where he heard about our Pandemonium expeditionary plan. He came to us first and promised support. Even I was surprised.
Completable_String1=I've already reported on the incident at the Airship Dockyard. Good job.<br>That traitor got away, but we'll catch her. We'd better tighten our security, too. I've got more things to do now.
Completable_String2=I'm surprised that you're supporting the construction of the airship. Why, do you want to attack Pandemonium, too?
Completable_String3=Of course not. I'm a businessman. When I see a good business opportunity, I try to pursue it as aggressively as I can.<br>The Pandemonium expeditionary plan happens to match my and my group's goals, which includes the survival of the MU Continent.
Completable_String4=Unbelievable. I would've been more dubious if you said you were supporting this project out of the kindness of your heart.
Completable_String5=This Pandemonium expeditionary project costs a tremendous amount of resources, but it also offers an amazing business opportunity. I want to capitalize on that. And who knows? The things that we might find in that new continent could be more valuable than their weight in gold.
Complete_String=Dumpain sees even this Pandemonium expeditionary project as a way of making money. His greed is frightening, but his ability to see the big picture (he described Pandemonium as a new continent) is impressive at the same time.
List_String=The patron of the airship for the Pandemonium expeditionary project is none other than Dumpain. It's not surprising, seeing that he's the richest man on the MU Continent, but him supporting an expedition into Pandemonium? You live and learn.
Mission_String=Report to Dumpain with the incident at the Airship Dockyard
Mission_Target1=Talk to Dumpain

[Quest_241]
Name=Protect the Airship
Occur_String1=You're %s_9_1. I've heard you helped improve the airship and stopped the Demons that came to destroy it.<br>Our Pandemonium invasion plan would've been ruined if it weren't for you.
Occur_String2=As you know, we're looking for routes to Pandemonium. This won't be easy, of course. The biggest obstacle is the Demons and their lackeys that wouldn't stop attacking the airship.
Occur_String3=That's why we need help from strong warriors like you. It'll be very helpful if you join this airship's expedition. What do you say?
Doing_String=This airship is the pinnacle of the MU Continent's magic and scientific technology.
Completable_String1=An army of Demons and their lackeys are blocking this airship. It won't be easy to find routes.
Completable_String2=The fact that they're determined to stop our ship proves how big of a threat it is to them.<br>Good job, %s_9_1. I hope you'll help us often. Of course, we'll repay you for your effort.
Complete_String=I stopped the Demons and their lackeys that attacked the airship. But they're coming wave after wave, making it dangerous to continue with this journey. Finding routes, or even maintaining them afterward, will be a big challenge.
List_String=Stop the Demons and their lackeys that attack the airship and help it find routes to Pandemonium.

Name=Secret Shadow Phantom Training Center
Occur_String1=Can I talk to you for a minute?
Occur_String2=Yes. What do you need?
Occur_String3=By the look of it... you seem to be having it rough these days. Maybe you're frustrated because it's not as easy as it used to be on the other continents, and you get fresh scars every day...
Occur_String4=Are you trying to insult me?
Occur_String5=No, on the contrary. I want to help you. You see, there is a secret training facility used by us Shadow Phantoms near here.
Occur_String6=It's a place for trainees before they get accepted. If you want to hone your skills but don't have much time, that's the place for you.
Occur_String7=Just get to the point. Are you saying you'll let me train there?
Occur_String8=I would, if I could. But, as you know, I'm not the Shadow Phantom commander. But you can try talking to her highness to ask her permission.
Occur_String9=So, I need Lunedill's permission.<br>Got it. I'll go talk to her right away.
Doing_String=Her highness seems to favor you. I think she'll let you use that place.
Completable_String1=Ah, good to see you.%s_9_1What brings you here?<br>Did you miss me? Is that it?
Complete_String=Iris seems to want to help me in training myself, after seeing my struggle in Noria. She mentioned a training facility reserved for Shadow Phantoms. To train there, I need Lunedill's permission.

Occur_String1=I was just passing by.
Occur_String2=You're lying, judging from the look on your face.<br>Come on! What is it? Don't keep me in the dark.
Occur_String3=Being a knight in Noria... is harder than I thought. Iris saw how I'm struggling here and suggested I try going to their training center.
Occur_String4=So... you need my permission. Is that it?
Occur_String5=Yes. I want to be able to help you, but I'm not really sure if I can.
Occur_String6=No, you've come all the way here to help us! What kind of princess would I be if I turned you down? Here is a permit. Show it to Iris.
Occur_String7=I appreciate it. I'll train and up my game so that I can be of help to you.
Occur_String8=Oh, before you go, why don't you talk to Linsey? She is one of the Shadow Phantoms who completed the training program most recently.
Doing_String=You two have met before, so maybe she has some essential advice for you.
Completable_String1=Ah, did you talk to her highness?
Complete_String=As I expected, Lunedill allowed me to train at the Shadow Phantom Training Center. Also, she suggested that I talk to Linsey, one of the Shadow Phantoms guarding the princess's residence. I have to pay a visit to Linsey and ask for her advice.

Occur_String1=I've been here several times, but I haven't greeted you properly.<br>I hope you understand.
Occur_String2=Don't even worry about it! By the way, what brings you here today?
Occur_String3=I've been helping people around here, and Iris thought I could use some training. So she suggested that I use one of your training sites.
Occur_String4=Ah, you mean that training center for rookies?<br>That place... um... definitely boosts your skills...
Occur_String5=The way you said that... Is there a problem?
Occur_String6=Well, it's nothing serious, but... You have to fight endless waves of monsters.<br>I went there as a trainee once, and I almost...
Occur_String7=Endless waves of monsters? That's got to help you hone your skills.
Occur_String8=In a way, yes. Well, I'm glad you see it that way!
Occur_String9=Thanks for the advice. I'll drop and say hello next time.
Doing_String=Yes! I hope you get what you want soon!
Completable_String1=There you are! Did you get the permit?
Completable_String2=A permit from the princess herself.<br>Now, can I enter?
Completable_String3=Sure! Well, good luck!
Complete_String=Linsey, who I haven't talked to in a while, was as cheerful as ever. Linsey told me about the training facility and the endless waves of monsters... That should be perfect for honing my skills.

Occur_String1=We needed some monsters for the novice trainees. And we don't have enough instructors to cover all the types of monsters. So, we tamed some Shamas because these monsters are relatively easy to train. They're the easiest opponents that you can fight at this facility. What do you think?

At the Mock Combat Center, instructors disguised as those demons await trainees to give them the experience they need. It is as good as fighting the real ones.

Complete_String=I searched the plains for Zakarian, but I couldn't find him. I found his lackey, named Duey, instead. Duey gave me Zakarian's letter, in which he wrote that he wasn't sure if I wasn't a puppet of Pandemonium before I lost my memories. He also wrote he would help me get my memories back if I pass a few tests and prove my good intentions.

Complete_String=The Dracans Nencha, a descendant of Wallkreiger and a keeper of the Sanctum of Dragon Knights, asked me to retrieve a key that could break the seal over the sanctum.<br>I found the key hidden in a statue by another descendant of Wallkreiger, who was in league with the mysterious group of intruders, and brought it back.

Occur_String1=Hmm... We found all the keys for the first floor and started managing it again...
Occur_String2=But... the second floor's entrance is blocked... There are traps on the second floor to ward off infiltrators...
Occur_String3=Those traps have been made by materializing elementals. They only carry out orders that they are given, so the traps cannot be removed without the key.
Occur_String4=I see... So where is the key?
Occur_String5=It won't be easy this time.<br>I tried to find the key, but I couldn't pinpoint its location. It looks like Zurataken really used his brain this time. I think he hid the key inside someone who wanders around the sanctum. It might be a Ghost Dragon... but there are a lot of them.
Occur_String6=I'll take care of it. I'll just get rid of them all. <br>But, the locations of the hidden keys are so similar. You won't say that the next key is hidden inside the Dragon King, will you?
Occur_String7=No way! No keeper can bother the Dragon King like that. <br>And, someone like Zurataken can't even see his toenails. How would he hide a key inside the Dragon King? <br>Hahahaha. Funny idea.
Doing_String=The Dragon King is the supreme being of this sanctum, and no one can hide a key inside his body.
Completable_String1=Thanks, I was able to find a lot of keys thanks to you... But... there's a problem...
Complete_String=The Dracans Nencha, who was a descendant of Wallkreiger and a keeper of the Sanctum of Dragon Knights, asked me to retrieve a key that could break the seal over the sanctum.<br>But Zurataken hid the key inside a living being to hide its exact location, so I had to get rid of all the Ghost Dragons.

Occur_String2=The sanctum's powerful and eternal system has been lost.<br>The Dragon King, the ruler of this sanctum, has tried to stop the corruption but he succumbed to this mysterious madness that ruins everything.<br>This place is no longer a sanctum.
Occur_String3=I guess there's a complicated history.

Occur_String3=....
Occur_String4=No way...
Occur_String5=Yes. Knight... You were right. After you left, I tracked the location of the last key just in case.
Occur_String6=It looks like the fallen Dragon King swallowed the last key in order to stop external forces from intervening. It looks like the key is still intact inside the Dragon King's body... but it won't last long.
Occur_String7=*Sigh* So we must open up Kaizel's body now.

Occur_String2=We were sent here to round up the remnants of the Pandemonium Army on the lower part of the Sky Temple.<br>We were about to commence our operation when a slew of dragons emerged out of the old cave in the north and attacked us.
Occur_String3=You're the elite of the Tephakin Army. Those dragons must have been really strong.
Occur_String4=They were incomparable to those that showed up in the fields.<br>Especially the one with two headsâ€”it killed most of us.<br>We would've all died if it didn't go back to the cave.
Occur_String5=I'll avenge your soldiers. You take care of the remaining soldiers.

Occur_String2=Then, why don't you block the entrance to the cave?
Occur_String3=No. There are strong dragons inside, and they will open up a new entrance to an unexpected region. And, even though this cave has been known for a long time, it's the first time that dragons have appeared. There must be someone who made the dragons move. I heard a rumor that Garudas could communicate with dragons in the past.
Occur_String4=And... I'm suspicious because we were attacked when we came to the Sky Temple to get rid of the Garudas. I saw a strange-looking Garuda inside the cave when the two-headed dragon appeared. I think the Garuda inside the cave controlled the two-headed dragon.
Occur_String5=If that Garuda really controlled the two-headed dragon, he will be a threat to you. <br>I'll take care of him. Don't worry.

Occur_String3=There are deadly dragons in this cave, but it's not hard for me to fight them one by one.<br>I was hunting just fine before those disgusting monsters appeared.
Occur_String4=Disgusting monsters?
Occur_String5=The Cave Wyverns. They remembered my smell and now they attack me whenever I hunt a dragon. The problem is that I can't hide from them while avoiding the dragon's attacks, in an enclosed space like a cave...
Occur_String6=Why don't you hunt down both?
Occur_String7=Hey, I'm a hunter, not a fighter. There isn't much I can do if they both attack me at once. And those Cave Wyverns are so clever. I've been in the cave several times to get rid of them first, but they never come near me when I'm not hunting a dragon.
Occur_String8=It would be so easy to shoot them in the head if they appeared in front of me. <br>I think the Cave Wyverns are pretty smart. They seem to avoid me with intelligence. I need someone strong, who they haven't smelled yet. Can you help me?

Occur_String1=A facility existing in such a remote place. It can't be for a good purpose.
Occur_String2=This is one of the factories we built to create weapons against the elves' World Tree.<br>But as you can see, it's been shut down.<br>We couldn't handle the tentacle test subject that raged out of control. We've had to shut down the whole facility for the time being.
Occur_String3=What's the problem?
Occur_String4=That test subject absorbs our telepathic energy. That's why we can't do anything about it.<br>We can't fight it without using telepathy, and using telepathy makes it grow bigger.
Occur_String5=But it can't be left alone. It spreads mutant spores, infecting nearby animals and plants.<br>Eventually it'll turn all of Noria into a warped land of death!
Occur_String6=What should I do about the mutant spores? I don't think they're not something I can stop, or even tolerate.
Occur_String7=Don't worry. We have a vaccine that works like a charm.
Occur_String8=Then why don't you take it and fight the thing yourself?
Occur_String9=That vaccine has a critical side effect: it disables telepathy.<br>That's why we can't use it.<br>We need your help.
Occur_String10=...<br>Sigh. Give me the vaccine. Let me take a look at least.
Doing_String=We're baffled by this situation too. I don't know how it went wrong so quickly.
Completable_String1=How bad is it? Serious?
Complete_String=The situation inside the restricted area was more serious than I thought. The test subject had infected animals, plants, and even people in there. They must be stopped before they turn all of Noria into their breeding ground.

Occur_String2=Huh? A noise? Oh, no! What if the test subject summoned Thud-tle?
Occur_String3=Thud-tle? What is that, a pet?
Occur_String4=It's an artificial life form that we created in this facility, as well as the Tentacle. We thought about naming it after the mythical monster, Khkulsaz.<br>The Tentacle and Khkulsaz. We had to choose the better weapon between the two.
Occur_String5=Khkulsaz, even though he was big and scary-looking, was gentle and liked people. He was kind of cute, too.<br>In the end, we chose the Tentacle as our weapon, and renamed Khkulsaz Thud-tle. So yes, he was our pet. A cute pet.
Occur_String6=And Thud-tle's pen was near the Tentacle's. We couldn't bring him out with us when the Tentacle raged out of control.
Occur_String7=Can you turn him back into what he used to be?
Occur_String8=No. We would've done it already if we could.

Occur_String10=...Yes.
Doing_String=I should've saved Thud-tle no matter how dangerous it was...
Completable_String1=Thud-tle was all but a plant by the time I found him. He must have been the first one infected by the Tentacle when all hell broke loose.<br>There would've been nothing you could do even if you had gone to him. Don't beat yourself up.

Occur_String2=We may not be perfect, but we tried really hard to cover all the basics. We thought we had accounted for all the possibilities.
Occur_String3=Plus, who thought the test object would absorb our telepathic energy?<br>We wouldn't have made it if we knew that, now would we? Only fools would make a weapon to harm themselves.
Occur_String4=I'm telling you this, whatever you did or didn't do, you're responsible for what's happening.<br>So, where's this raging test subject?
Occur_String5=It used to be isolated in a ward near where you found Thud-tle. It's farther in the back.

I've heard he's as knowledgeable as Archmage Kundun when it comes to magic and science. He's also well-versed in telepathy.<br>That's why he rose through the ranks to the top, despite his flaws.
Occur_String3=What flaws? He sounds all-around incredible to me.
Occur_String4=He's not a pureblood. He may be an expert in telepathy, but he's incapable of it.<br>We Ashases use telepathy to commune with one another. It's not exaggerating to say telepathy makes us who we are,<br>and those who don't have it aren't true Ashases.

Occur_String2=But, with the recent war against the Ashas and the chaos resulting from it, they started neglecting their duty to protect the World Trees and some of them even tried to attack us Elves.
Occur_String3=It's probably because their minds are unstable, since they were made with weak magic power.<br>They can only cause trouble at times like this, so I think it will be better to cut them down.
Occur_String4=You are the ones who created them. Isn't that too much?<br>It looks like Elves aren't as affectionate as I thought.

Occur_String3=The Elves tried to use the World Trees to annihilate us.<br>If we can get our revenge by destroying their cherished temple, then we will do it.
Occur_String4=...<br>So in your mind, you're not fighting to dominate the elves, but to end war and promote peace.<br>Do you think revenge is the answer to war?
Occur_String5=I'm not an Elf nor an Ashas, but I know for sure that if you destroy the Sapientia Temple, this war will fall into a bottomless pit.<br>That's why I can't just stand and watch, for the same reason as you. I want to end this war.
Occur_String6=...<br>Yes, maybe you're right.<br>We started off with the intention of ending the war, but we forgot that goal along the way. Now we're fighting just to get back at the enemy.

Occur_String1=I think I can translate it, but it'll take a while. I'll have to check some reference materials, too.<br>By the way, are you busy?
Occur_String2=Why, do you need something?
Occur_String3=I've heard that the Ashases have a secret facility in Wellspring Haven, and a big turtle that looks like a plant lives there.
Occur_String4=You mean Thud-tle. But how did you know about it? That facility is literally a secret.
Occur_String5=My Society is better connected than you think. Hah hah!<br>While I translate this, could you get the seedsâ€”eggs?â€”of Thud-tle for me?
Occur_String6=Why? Do you want to grow them?
Occur_String7=I want to try. I've heard that turtle's cute, and since it's big, perhaps I could ride mine later.
Doing_String=Thud-tle sounds cute, but I'm going to give mine a different name.
Completable_String1=These are the seeds of that turtle, Thud-tle. Mm, let's see... I wonder if they'll grow well in Fabrice's Garden. I'd better ask Tall later.
Completable_String2=Seriously, are you really going to grow them? They're monsters.
Completable_String3=Maybe I could grow them into good monsters. What do you think?
Completable_String4=*Sigh* Do whatever you like.<br>Did you finish translating the rubbing?
Complete_String=Once again, I've confirmed that the Rift Research Society is filled with eccentrics. Even Hyre, who I thought was the most normal one, asked me for monster seeds because she wanted to grow and ride them later.
List_String=Hyre has asked me for Thud-tle's seeds because she heard it was big and cute. Maybe she's the strangest person at the Society...
Mission_String=Go along with Hyre's peculiar idea
Mission_Target1=Thud-tle's Seed

[Quest_1754]
Name=Riddle on the Monument 1
Occur_String1=Yes, I did. It was a little bit difficult, but I cross-checked my translation against the reference materials several times. It should be good enough.
Occur_String2=This is the content of the rubbing:<br>"Explore the scar of the spiral carved on the land resembling the sharp light that grows in the dark."
Occur_String3=...It's a riddle. I think it's indicating a certain location.
Occur_String4=My thoughts exactly. Perhaps you'll find what you're looking for in that location, %s_9_1. Or another clue.<br>I just have no idea where it is, though.
Occur_String5=Neither do I. Anyway, I'll let Senozana Edney know. Great job.
Occur_String6=Mm? Senozana Edney? That name sounds familiar. Where have I heard it before?<br>For now, I'll look for the location in the riddle. I'll let you know if I find it.
Doing_String=Mm... I know that name, but for some reason I can't remember whom it belongs to...
Completable_String1=Here's the translation of the rubbing:<br>"Explore the scar of the spiral carved on the land resembling the sharp light that grows in the dark."
Completable_String2=A riddle. There must be something at the location in the riddle.<br>At least, I don't think it's on another continent. Back in the old days, it was difficult to move between continents, and since this message was left by ancient Ashases, the corresponding location has to be within Noria.
Completable_String3=I hope so.
Completable_String4=By the way, who translated this?
Completable_String5=Hyre at the Rift Research Society. Do you know her?
Completable_String6=Hyre... Hyre. That sounds familiar. It has a familiar ring to it. Mm... Argh, this is frustrating. I hate it when I can't remember people's names.<br>Anyway, I'll try to solve the riddle, too. Let me know if you think of something, and I'll let you know if I do.
Complete_String=Even Senozana Edney didn't know what the message on the monument meant.<br>"Explore the scar of the spiral carved on the land resembling the sharp light that grows in the dark."<br>Senozana Edney thinks, considering the situation in ancient times, the location can't be outside Noria. Then, where is it in Noria?
List_String=The message on the monument was a riddle that indicated a certain location. Neither Hyre nor I could figure out where it was, so I decided to just go back to Senozana Edney. Will she know where it is?
Mission_String=Relay the revealed riddle of the monument
Mission_Target1=Talk to Senozana Edney

[Quest_1755]
Name=Finding the Place in the Riddle 1
Completable_String1=This monument looks similar to the last one I found. Maybe this place is the answer to the riddle!
Completable_String2=...Wait!
Completable_String3=Mm? Why?
Complete_String=While investigating the Maze of Scales, we discovered a monument similar to the last one. But... why is it giving off these weird vibes?
List_String=(The location for this quest does not display. Please solve the riddle.)<br>"Explore the scar of the spiral carved on the land resembling the sharp light that grows in the dark."<br>I don't know how long I've been wandering around, thinking about this riddle. What if the place or object at which it points is long gone? Then, I'd be just wasting my time in here.
Mission_String=Find the location in the riddle
Mission_Target1=Find the location in the riddle

[Quest_1756]
Name=Waylaying Monsters 1
Occur_String1=.....
Occur_String2=%s_9_1?
Occur_String3=There's something here. Stay where you are. I'll take care of it.
Occur_String4=Got it!
Completable_String1=So, this was it. I saw you fight. Thank the gods, I didn't come earlier than you.<br>You found it before I did. %s_9_1, you never disappoint me.
Completable_String2=Hyre! How did you know this was the place?
Completable_String3=I happened to look up at the night sky and saw a crescent moon. It reminded of the sharp light that grows in the dark. So, I checked Crescent Moon Island on the map of Noria.
Completable_String4=There was a spiral-shaped area on the island, and I thought the scar had to be the Maze of Scales. That's how I put all the pieces together.<br>Isn't that how you found this place too, %s_9_1?
Completable_String5=O-of course, it is!
Completable_String6=R-right! But we found it almost at the same time. It doesn't matter who found it first, does it?
Complete_String=After I defeated the monsters who ambushed us, Hyre also showed up. She was a bit later than us, but while we found this place by some fluke, she actually solved the riddle.
List_String=I get the feeling something dangerous is about to show up. I better take care of it. This has to be the place described by the riddle.
Mission_String=Subdue the mysterious Guardian that emerged suddenly
Mission_Target1=Defeat the mysterious Guardian

[Quest_1757]
Name=Riddle on the Monument 2
Occur_String1=Here's another monument. I knew the first one would lead us to the second one.
Occur_String2=And this one has to lead us to a third one, right?
Occur_String3=I hope the next one is the last.<br>What does it read?
Occur_String4=Wait... This...<br>"A holy constellation consisting of lights that peacefully fell asleep after setting a course to greatness. Defeat the gatekeeper who protects the myth."<br>It's another riddle. Where do you think this place is?
Occur_String5=A course to greatness... Lights that fell asleep... Constellation... Myth... Gatekeeper...
Occur_String6=Bah, the ancient Ashases sure enjoyed making things complicated!
Doing_String=Hm... I wonder if it's some sort of tomb...
Completable_String1=By the way, you're Hyre, right? Have we met before? For some reason you look familiar to me.
Completable_String2=So do you. Where might I have seen you before?
Completable_String3=*Ahem* I'm sure you've got a lot to ask each other, but you should ask them on the way out. I don't think it's a good idea to stay here.<br>Leave first. I want to look around for a little longer, just in case.
Complete_String=Hyre and Senozana Edney seemed like they had a lot to talk about so I asked them to leave first. This is not a good place to talk.
List_String=The second monument read, "A holy constellation consisting of lights that peacefully fell asleep after setting a course to greatness. Defeat the gatekeeper who protects the myth." Which place is this message indicating? Suddenly, I wonder how the ancient Ashases even talked to each other. Maybe something as simple as saying hello was all long and drawn out.
Mission_String=Listen to Senozana Edney and Hyre talk
Mission_Target1=Talk to Senozana Edney

[Quest_1758]
Name=Outside the Labyrinth
Completable_String1=You're back. Did you find anything else of interest?
Completable_String2=No. I think we should just solve the second riddle.
Completable_String3=Oh right, the two of us talked as we left, and we realized that we studied together under Kamok. No wonder she looked familiar to me.
Completable_String4=I can't say how frustrated I felt because I couldn't remember her. Now I know. What a relief!
Completable_String5=Two old classmates reunited by accident. This must have been a pleasant surprise for the both of you.
Complete_String=Senozana Edney and Hyre studied under the same teacher. This explains why they thought they'd heard of each other before. They must have a lot to talk about, now that these two old classmates have reunited.
List_String=First, I need to investigate this maze thoroughly, in case there are any more clues. Then, I should talk to the girls waiting for me outside.
Mission_String=Exit the Maze of Scales
Mission_Target1=Thoroughly investigate the Maze of Scales
Mission_Target2=Talk to Senozana Edney outside the Maze

[Quest_1759]
Name=Finding the Place in the Riddle 2
Occur_String1=So, have you thought about what location the riddle might be indicating?
Occur_String2=It was "A holy constellation consisting of lights that peacefully fell asleep after setting a course to greatness. Defeat the gatekeeper who protects the myth," right?<br>Hm... I don't know. I think it's some sort of tomb, but...
Occur_String3=I agree with her. I think it's a national cemetery where important figures are buried. The language in the riddle sounds kind of formal, so I think that's likely.
Occur_String4=Okay, then I'll look for places like that.<br>You two should look for any relevant documents and records. I'll go this way. I'll let you know if I find anything.
Occur_String5=That'll be great. We'll let you know as soon as we find anything that might be useful.
Occur_String6=Good luck, %s_9_1!
Doing_String=Hm... Where do you think this place described in the riddle is?
Complete_String=The place described by the riddle was the Pilgrim's Rest. It's where the Ashases who moved to the MU continent worked hard to create a new home for themselves and their future generations until they died. It fits the description, "A holy constellation consisting of lights that peacefully fell asleep after setting a course to greatness." What kind of riddle will I find on the monument in this place? Could this be the last one?
List_String=(The location for this quest does not display. Please solve the riddle.)<br>"A holy constellation consisting of lights that peacefully fell asleep after setting a course to greatness. Defeat the gatekeeper who protects the myth."<br>While the previous riddle described a location, this one describes the purpose or characteristics of a place. Where is this place?
Mission_String=Find the location in the riddle
Mission_Target1=Find the location

[Quest_1760]
Name=Riddle on the Monument 3
Occur_String1=We'll know if we check what's written on the monument. Can you read it?
Occur_String2=Hm... Hyre, could you translate this? I'm not fluent in this ancient language yet.
Occur_String3=Okay, let's see...<br>"No matter how cruelly the beauty treats us, we'll stand tall at the end of the land and refuse to be swayed."<br>This almost sounds like a poem or song. The ancient Ashases must have been very artistic.
Occur_String4=We failed to find something, again.
Occur_String5=But isn't it fun to find clues like this? They're leading us to the ancient remains of a race that came from a different dimension. Where else can we try? I'm glad I've decided to study the Ashases.
Occur_String6=At least we have some clues this time. Most of the time, there are no clues whatsoever and I have to do a lot of legwork.<br>I feel lucky that we've actually found some sort of lead.
Occur_String7=We're really going to go everywhere on the Noria continent for this, aren't we? Alright, then let's scatter and look for the location.<br>"No matter how cruelly the beauty treats us, we'll stand tall at the end of the land and refuse to be swayed," right?<br>Let's resume our search.
Doing_String=The land where a beauty treats them cruelly... What does it mean? Where do you think it is?
Completable_String1=%s_9_1, what brings you here?
Completable_String2=Mm... Since you're an Ashas, perhaps you can help me. Do you by any chance...?
Complete_String=While looking for clues to solve the riddle on the monument, I met the Ashas researcher, Celrun, at the front of the Restricted Area. Perhaps he knows about the riddle. I should ask him.
List_String=(The location for this quest does not display. Please solve the riddle.)<br>The third monument read, "No matter how cruelly the beauty treats us, we'll stand tall at the end of the land and refuse to be swayed." Senozana Edney and Hyre had fun looking for clues like this and were grateful they were still intact. Oh well, I might as well enjoy this.
Mission_String=Commence investigating the riddle
Mission_Target1=Solve the riddle on the monument

[Quest_1761]
Name=Finding the Place in the Riddle 3
Occur_String1=You're looking for a relic of my ancestors? Of course, I'll help.<br>"No matter how cruelly the beauty treats us, we'll stand tall at the end of the land and refuse to be swayed."<br>My ancestors have such a beautiful way of expressing things.
Occur_String2=Let me think... Ah!<br>Can it be talking about this Wellspring Haven?
Occur_String3=This place?
Occur_String4=Yes. Wellspring Haven has long been a battlefield between us Ashases and the elves. And the elves are, for better or worse, beautiful. The history of this land and the beautiful appearances of the elves match that phrase, don't you think?
Occur_String5=Then, the end of the land is...
Occur_String6=It has to be here, the Restricted Area. Hm, come to think of it, I've heard this place was an ancient facility used by us Ashases. There's a good possibility that this is the place.
Occur_String7=I think you're right. Let me double-check.
Doing_String=I hope your investigation will be successful. If you follow the traces of my ancestors and find some kind of relic, it'll be very helpful to us Ashases, too.
Completable_String1=Did you find anything in the Restricted Area?
Completable_String2=No. It was a waste of time. I even searched the Intensive Cultivation Room, but there were no clues.<br>The more I think about it, though, I'm sure this is the place.
Completable_String3=Then... perhaps what my ancestors left behind was lost during the construction of this facility. Like you said, those monuments don't reveal themselves to just anyone.<br>Oh gods, what did we do...?
Completable_String4=My ancestors shed blood, sweat, and tears to turn this land into a new home for their kind. And we, their descendants, destroyed what they left for us instead of honoring it.<br>I feel so ashamed that I can barely look you in the eye.
Complete_String=I searched the Restricted Area and even the Intensive Cultivation Room, but I didn't find any ancient Ashas monument or other clues. Celrun thought it might have been destroyed or lost during the construction of this facility. I was disappointed, but not as much as Celrun, who was devastated at the possibility that his kind might have destroyed the legacy of their ancestors.
List_String=After listening to Celrun, I was convinced that the riddle on the monument was pointing us towards this place, the Restricted Area in Wellspring Haven. I should be able to find the next clue or the actual relic here.
Mission_String=Find the location in the riddle
Mission_Target1=Investigate Restricted Area 6-1
Mission_Target2=Investigate the Intensive Cultivation Room

[Quest_1762]
Name=Return Empty-handed
Occur_String1=*Sigh* I should leave for now. I don't think I can find any more information or clues.<br>Now, where can I find those two? Maybe they're at the Rift Research Society.
Occur_String2=*Sigh* I can't believe we've made such a grave mistake... Oh, my ancestors, I don't know what to say.<br>Please forgive your foolish descendants.
Occur_String3=...<br>(I'd better leave him alone for now.)
Doing_String=...<br>(I'll give him some space. He's tormented with guilt.)
Completable_String1=I've found a place that could be the one from the riddle, but there was no new clue or monument in there.
Completable_String2=Are you serious? Where is it?
Completable_String3=Restricted Area 6-1 at the end of Wellspring Haven.
Completable_String4=Wellspring Haven... I see. It's one of the biggest battlefields among the Ashases and the elves. I can see it matches the riddle. But you didn't find anything there, you say?
Completable_String5=A researcher told me that the Restricted Area was built on some ancient Ashas facility. He thought the monument might have been destroyed or lost during its construction.<br>Did you find any more clues or interpretations of the riddle? And where's Senozana Edney?
Completable_String6=Oh... I looked up several reference books, but I couldn't find anything. And she's in Ethedrean. Seeing that she hasn't contacted me, she must not have found anything, either. Geez... I feel burned out. This isn't the first time that my investigation led to nothing. I can't help but feel disappointed every time it happens.
Completable_String7=But there must be more cluesâ€”or somethingâ€”somewhere. This monument may have been destroyed or lost by accident, but everything else was in good condition.<br>It's too early to give up. I'm not ready to quit just yet.
Completable_String8=I'll keep looking. %s_9_1, if you find any more clues while on a different request or mission, let me know. I'll let you know if I find anything, too.<br>I'll let Senozana know this.
Completable_String9=Got it. She'll be disappointed once she hears about it. Take good care of her.
Complete_String=The Restricted Area in Wellspring Haven was the most likely place described by the riddle. It was nearly a perfect match. It's a shame that the clues in there might have been destroyed or lost. But I'm not ready to give it up just yet, and neither are Hyre and Senozana Edney. We'll just have to keep looking.
List_String=I didn't find any clues or information related to the riddle. I should leave for now. Perhaps I can find Hyre or Senozana Edney at the Rift Research Society.
Mission_String=Return to the Rift Research Society
Mission_Target1=Talk to Hyre

[Quest_1763]
Name=The Lost Clue
Completable_String1=You came, %s_9_1. Hyre told me what happened. I'm really disappointed. I knew things were going way too smoothly. Do you think this is as far as we can go? I looked up some other reference books, but I didn't find any more clues.
Completable_String2=About that, I've got good news. Take a look at this.
Completable_String3=This is... an ancient Ashas message that I've never seen before! Where did you find it? My goodness, you're amazing!
Completable_String4=In the Maze of Scales. I found it while hunting monsters. Say, do you think you can use it to continue with the investigation?
Completable_String5=Of course! Let me check. I've learned how to translate the ancient Ashas language from Hyre.<br>Let's see... This means god, this means home, and this, I think, is stage. And...
Complete_String=I found a new Ashas monument in Mythic Stage 2 Maze of Scales. I brought the message to Senozana Edney in Ethedrean, and she nearly jumped with joy. I'd better find out what the message says.
List_String=(The location for this quest does not display. Please look for new clues in dungeons in Noria.)<br>Unfortunately, the clue that we thought was in the Restricted Area in Wellspring Haven is missing, putting a halt to our investigation. Now I'll have to do a lot of legwork to find more clues. I'd better keep my eyes open wherever I go in Noria.
Mission_String=Find new clues about the Ashas relic
Mission_Target1=Find new clues

[Quest_1764]
Name=Riddle on the Monument 4
Occur_String1=I'm done! It took a while to translate the message, though.<br>It reads, "Put to sleep the timid gatekeepers in the new home filled with the second story of the gods, and another stage will welcome you. Rejoice to pay respect."<br>What does it mean? What kind of place is that supposed to be? I don't think it's just about finding a place. We need to do something there, too.
Occur_String2=I think you're right. It's fun to solve and follow riddles like this.
Occur_String3=I know, right? This is what makes archaeology so fascinating, following ancient records and clues to uncover secrets.
Occur_String4=But I don't think I'll want to do this again after we get to the bottom of this mystery.
Occur_String5=Oh, you don't? But... hm... you enjoy this, right?
Occur_String6=It's worth my time and it's rewarding, of course. Okay, let's search again.
Doing_String=Who knew the Ashases, who mainly communicate with telepathy, would have left so many written records?
Complete_String=To the Ashases, the new home meant Sleighbowa, and the second story of the gods meant Mythic Stage 2. After I got that, I found and defeated the gatekeepers of the place. Then, a new path opened, guiding me to a new monument.
List_String=(The location for this quest does not display. Please solve the riddle.)<br>The message discovered this time is rather abstract. It seems I have to do something aside from finding a location to solve it.<br>"Put to sleep the timid gatekeepers in the new home filled with the second story of the gods, and another stage will welcome you. Rejoice to pay respect."<br>First things first: I need to find the location. Where did the Ashas ancestors hide this relic?
Mission_String=Commence investigating the riddle
Mission_Target1=Find the location in the riddle

[Quest_1765]
Name=Rejoice to Pay Respect
Occur_String1=The ancient Ashas message says, "Rejoice to pay respect." I have to find out what this means.
Occur_String2=If I solve this riddle, I'll either get a new clue or the relic I've been looking for.
Doing_String=Rejoice to pay respect..." What does that mean?
Complete_String=As I danced in front of the monument, some writing started to appear on it. People usually dance when they're happy, and dances originated from ceremonial gestures to worship the gods. It seems fitting for the message, "Rejoice to pay respect."
List_String=(Instructions to complete this quest are not displayed. Please solve the riddle.)<br>The newly found monument had no letters or patterns on it. I'm thinking they're hidden by some mysterious power. Perhaps I can reveal them by solving the riddle, "Rejoice to pay respect."
Mission_String=Accurately translate the riddle
Mission_Target1=Rejoice to pay respect

[Quest_1766]
Name=Mysterious Guardian 2
Completable_String1=Welcome back. I've just solved the riddle!<br>The new home means Sleighbowa, and the story of the gods means the Mythic difficulty. And I think "Rejoice to pay respect" means that you have to dance.
Completable_String2=I see. Very accurate. Then, what about this phrase?
Completable_String3=Hm? What's this... a new clue! Oh gosh, you figured out everything and even went there.<br>If you knew the answers, why didn't you tell me? %s_9_1, you're more mischievous than I thought.
Complete_String=I brought the new clue I found from the monument to Senozana Edney. She was excited about solving the riddle when I showed her this clue I found in Sleighbowa. She half sullenly said I was being mischievous and I felt bad for not telling her earlier.
List_String=Along with the hidden writing and patterns, a monster that protected the riddle of this place also showed up. I'll have to take care of it to check the monument.
Mission_String=Defeat the mysterious guardian and check the monument
Mission_Target1=Kill Elite monsters
Mission_Target2=Check the monument

[Quest_1767]
Name=Riddle on the Monument 5
Occur_String1=*Ahem* I'm sorry I didn't tell you earlier. If it weren't for you or Hyre, I couldn't have come this far... or do anything else for that matter.
Occur_String2=No. Come to think of it, we couldn't have done this if it weren't for you, either, %s_9_1.<br>Now, let's take a look at the message you've brought this time, shall we?
Occur_String3=Oho... This is... good news. We're on the home stretch now. This message is written differently from the rest.<br>"The forge of the mind that produces brilliant minds. Take two steps forward into that myth and prove your skills to find three duties."
Occur_String4=This message is not as abstract as the others. It's specifically telling you to discover three duties. Find three duties in the location in the riddle, and perhaps we'll finally have some answers!
Occur_String5=Only one place is described in the riddle, but there are three duties. Maybe you can find all of them there.
Occur_String6=And it says prove your skills. I don't know how, but depending on how well you prove your skills, perhaps you get different duties.
Occur_String7=I think so. Now we just have to find where this place described by the riddle is.<br>I'd better let Hyre know.
Doing_String=What do you think the Ashases are hiding? I can't wait to find out!
Complete_String=I discovered all three duties mentioned in the riddle from the monument. The only thing left to do now is to complete these duties.
List_String=(The location or method for this quest does not display. Please solve the riddle.)<br>This message from the monument was different from the others.<br>"The forge of the mind that produces brilliant minds. Take two steps forward into that myth and prove your skills to find three duties."<br>I have a feeling that I'm almost at the end of this quest. I need to just find the place, prove my skills, and then reveal the three duties...
Mission_String=Find the location and discover the 3 duties
Mission_Target1=Discover the 1st duty
Mission_Target2=Discover the 2nd duty
Mission_Target3=Discover the 3rd duty

[Quest_1768]
Name=Last Riddle - First Duty
Occur_String1=Another monument has appeared... this must be the duty from the Ashas ancestors! Let me check its message.<br>Mm... I think this is the first duty: "The second myth where the stars sleep. Embrace it before its light disappears."
Occur_String2=Based on the riddles we've solved so far, I think this one is indicating the Pilgrim's Rest. Ah, but you'll need to do it at Mythic Stage 2.
Occur_String3=It also says, "before its light disappears," which means...
Occur_String4=...you need to complete the duty as quickly as possible. Alright, we've been doing this so long that it's easy to solve the riddles now.
Doing_String=What do you think we'll find at the end?
Completable_String1=This must be the forgotten relic of the Ashases!
Completable_String2=How mysterious! I've never seen anything like this. It looks like some sort of energy, but it's got mass, I think.
Completable_String3=I can't believe there are more amazing things like this. I hope you'll be able to discover the remaining duties quickly.
Completable_String4=Let's go back to Mythic Stage 2 Whispering Cave and look for the other duties.
Complete_String=I completed the first duty and discovered a mysterious relic of the Ashases that looked like some sort of energy, but it seemed to have weight and mass. Now I need a new duty to find the next relic.
List_String=The first duty in the last riddle was to clear Mythic Stage 2 Pilgrim's Rest as quickly as possible. Now I'm so good at solving riddles, I don't have to wander around so much anymore. I should focus on completing the duties.
Mission_String=Complete the 1st duty
Mission_Target1=Defeat the Pilgrim's Rest Boss monster within the time limit

[Quest_1769]
Name=Last Riddle - Second Duty
Occur_String1=It's a new monument that tells us about the second duty! It reads...<br>"The second myth of the spiral in the bosom of the moon. Penetrate the maze."<br>I can definitely tell we're close to the end. Even the riddle sounds easier and simpler now.
Occur_String2=I think it means Mythic Stage 2 Maze of Scales. Judging by the use of the word "penetrate", I think you'll have to get rid of the ruler of that place quickly, just like you did for the first duty.
Occur_String3=Alright, let's go complete the second duty.
Doing_String=What do you think the Ashases are hiding?
Completable_String1=A new Ashas relic. It's surrounded by a glowing aura... So beautiful!
Completable_String2=What do you think will happen if we collect all the relics? Once, I found a storybook in the Rift that said if you collect seven orange balls with stars drawn on them, a green dragon will appear and grant your wishes. Do you think these relics will do the same?
Completable_String3=Well, I don't care so long as they're not as weird as those wishing balls you just described. Now, let's find the next duty.<br>I'll go back to Mythic Stage 2 Whispering Cave and look for it.
Complete_String=I completed the second duty and discovered a new Ashas relic. What can these relics do? What's their significance? I'll know soon enough, once I find them all.
List_String=The second duty in the last riddle is to clear Mythic Stage 2 Maze of Scales as quickly as possible. Now that I know what to do, I should do it right away.
Mission_String=Complete the 2nd duty
Mission_Target1=Defeat the Maze of Scales Boss monster within the time limit

[Quest_1770]
Name=Last Riddle - Third Duty
Occur_String1=Hurry back home and report to our ruler in the second myth,"<br>reads the message on the monument of the third duty.
Occur_String2=Then, it has to be Mythic Stage 2 Sleighbowa. I'll have to clear it as quickly as I can, like I did for the other two duties.
Occur_String3=Whoa, you're amazing! You solved straight away.
Occur_String4=Experience is the best teacher, as the old saying goes.
Occur_String5=You're so great! Then, let's go, shall we?
Doing_String=What kind of Ashas relic will be waiting for us?
Completable_String1=This is the Ashas relic from the third duty of the monument... I'm overwhelmed with emotion.<br>Now we can finally find out what it is.
Completable_String2=I want to know everything about this relic... its purpose, significance, power, history...
Completable_String3=An ancient relic of a race that came to the MU continent from a different dimension... How exciting!
Completable_String4=You've collected them all, right? If you haven't, you should check Mythic Stage 2 Whispering Cave for a new duty.
Complete_String=I completed the third duty in Sleighbowa and obtained an Ashas relic. I wonder where the light radiating from this relic will lead us and the Ashases.
List_String=The third duty in the last riddle is to clear Mythic Stage 2 Sleighbowa as quickly as possible. Pope King Bellias is not of sound mind, but that doesn't change the fact that he's the ruler. I should be able to complete the duty.

Name=Fratanne's Sudden Call
Completable_String1=You came, %s_9_1. I sensed a powerful flow of telepathic energy.<br>What happened?
Completable_String2=I might have discovered an artifact of the ancient Ashases. Do you know Senozana Edney, who's here?
Completable_String3=I do. She said she wanted to study our history, so I let her stay. We want to find as many of our ancestors' relics as we can.
Completable_String4=She and this researcher from the Rift Research Society named Hyre started this investigation. I helped them along the way.<br>We solved riddles on hidden monuments and followed their clues, one by one.
Completable_String5=I didn't know something like that even existed. The beacon does not shine on its own base. Who knew it was hidden in our village and our land?<br>So, what did you find at the end of your journey? It released enough energy for every Ashas in Noria to sense it.
Completable_String6=This is what we found. We don't know what it is.<br>I'm sure you might have some idea, though.
Complete_String=Fratanne telepathically contacted me, having sensed a powerful energy that suddenly spread across Noria. It seems this relic we found is more than meets the eye. An ancient artifact, forgotten even by the Ashases themselves. What is it?
List_String=As soon as I completed all the duties and discovered the three relics, Fratanne contacted me telepathically. I was surprised, but apparently not as much as Fratanne, judging by her emotion that I felt through our telepathic connection. For now, I should respond to her call and go to the safe house on Crescent Moon Island as she asked.
Mission_String=Respond to Fratanne's call
Mission_Target1=Talk to Fratanne in the Safe House

[Quest_1772]
Name=Asharium, a Treasure of Ashas
Occur_String1=This is Asharium! Oh gods, I didn't know our ancestors brought it with them! I'm so grateful that it's been preserved like this!
Occur_String2=This is a crystal believed to be an actual part of our Creator. I thought it was destroyed along with our home dimension. I didn't know my ancestors kept it safe.<br>Ahh, dear ancestors, please forgive your hopeless descendants.
Occur_String3=Asharium? Could you tell us what it is, exactly?
Occur_String4=We don't know everything about it. Actually, I just told you everything I know. But it's one of the most precious things to us Ashases.
Occur_String5=Mm... I'm sorry, but do you mind if we talk in private?
Completable_String1=I know I have no right to ask you this, but what you found originally belonged to us Ashases. I'd like you to give it back.<br>Of course, we'll give you anything you want, except the Asharium, for doing us such a great service. So please, will you give it to us?
Completable_String2=W-well... we found it... but it originally belonged to you...
Completable_String3=I don't know what to say... On the other hand, we could learn a lot by studying this. And it was only found because of our hard work, conducted with your approval.
Completable_String4=Please, I beg you. Let us fulfill our duties toward our ancestors.
Completable_String5=Mm... Then, how about this? We'll give this relic to you. In return, you should reward us and let these ladies study the Asharium under your watchful eye.<br>That way, you Ashases will have your precious relic back, and these two can continue with their study.
Completable_String6=Oh, that's a great idea.
Completable_String7=That'd be for the best! We can continue with our study and get a reward!
Completable_String8=I agree. I think it's a good compromise.
Completable_String9=Alright, then I'll let you take care of the rest. It's out of my hands now.<br>I'm glad everyone has gotten what they wanted. You Ashases have your relic back, and you'll get a reward for your research and a chance to continue with it.
Complete_String=The Ashases asked us to give them the stone in exchange for a handsome reward. Since it originally belonged to their people, it was right to return it to them, but the girls hesitated, not wanting to let go of something that they worked so hard to find. They also wanted to continue their research. So, I came up with a compromise, with which everyone agreed. I haven't felt this proud of myself for a long time.
List_String=The series of riddles that we solved led us to the Asharium, a mysterious crystal believed to be part of the Creator of the Ashases. The Ashases who saw it looked ecstatic. By the way, what was it that they wanted to talk about in private?
Mission_String=Listen to the conversation among the Ashases

Name=Waylaying Monsters 2
Completable_String1=So, the riddle was pointing towards the Pilgrim's Rest.<br>"A holy constellation consisting of lights that peacefully fell asleep after setting a course to greatness."<br>It's the burial place of the Ashases who worked hard to create a new home for themselves and their future generations in this new dimension, the MU continent.
Completable_String2=Back then, the Ashases called themselves "pilgrims" since they were forced to leave their home. The name, Pilgrim's Rest, was coined from that.<br>Do you think there's another clue in here, or maybe even the relic we're looking for?
Complete_String=After defeating the monsters that lay in wait near the location in the riddle, I called Hyre and Senozana Edney. What location is this monument indicating?
List_String=I must defeat the monsters lying in wait for those who came to solve the riddle. I'll let them know they're messing with the wrong guy.

Name=Source of the Mysterious Creatures
Occur_String1=I'm sure the Local Police has talked ill of us to you.<br>Those hillbillies can't see the forest for the trees.<br>The real problem of Dudrin is not those mutant animals.
Occur_String2=Then what else could it be? Are you saying that it's those spider-bitten nobles?
Occur_String3=I'm not finished.<br>Word is that strange creatures are pouring out of that Southeastern cave.<br>I'm afraid that they might have come from Pandemonium.
Occur_String4=Pandemonium?
Occur_String5=It's the Otherworld created by the god of destruction, Sekneum.<br>Two hundred years ago, the Pandemonium Army led the Demons and invaded MU.
Occur_String6=After the war that lasted three years, we managed to drive them back to where they came from,<br>but at the cost of half the continent's population.
Occur_String7=If those creatures in the cave are demons, then Pandemonium has returned after two hundred years.
Occur_String8=Now I've got a real mission for you.<br>Go to the cave and identify the creatures in there.
Doing_String=After the Three-Year War, we Humans, the Elves, and the Dwarves drove the demons away from the MU Continent.<br>Later, our three races formed an alliance named the Heraus Coalition.<br>Long live the Coalition!
Completable_String1=Creatures poured out of some blue waves?!<br>Are you sure? Darn... Darn it!
Complete_String=At the request of Lorencia Army Commander Leo, I went to the Amberial Forest to investigate the origin of strange creatures.

Name=Prelude to Pandemonium's Invasion
Occur_String1=Those blue waves are Rift tunnels called Evil Energy.<br>Do you remember what I told you last time? The Pandemonium Demons invaded the MU continent two hundred years ago.
Occur_String2=To come to the Earth, they created Rift tunnels everywhere on the continent. These tunnels are what we call Evil Energy.
Occur_String3=Pandemonium has invaded us again.<br>It's war.
Occur_String4=War? I've just landed in an unfamiliar place with no memories of my past.<br>You're kidding me, right?
Occur_String5=I wish I was.<br>We'd better warn all the members of the Heraus Coalition.<br>Of course, my country first, and then Noria, Mediah, and...?
Occur_String6=Calm yourself.<br>Warning other countries is not something I can help you with.
Occur_String7=Hmm... You can let Noria know. They happen to be here.<br>Head north, and you'll find the Shadow Phantom, the knights of the Noria Kingdom, and their commander Iris.<br>Tell her about the invasion quickly, as you always do.
Doing_String=The Shadow Phantoms are the knights of the Elf Kingdom of Noria. With the Devias Knights of Lorencia Kingdom, they are considered the best knights on the MU Continent. Their commander Iris and I can overcome this difficulty together.
Completable_String1=Hey, this is not a playground for inexperienced knights-errant like you.<br>Get out of here before you get yourself killed.
Complete_String=Leo said the blue waves I'd seen were the Evil Energy,  Rift tunnels used by the Pandemonium Army to invade this realm during the Three-year War.  At Leo's request, I went off to share this information with Iris, the commander of the Shadow Phantom.
List_String=(Enova Misión Principal) (9/48)<br>The Evil Energy, Rift tunnels that connect Pandemonium with this earthly realm, has been created in the Amberial Forest, heralding a Pandemonium invasion. I'd better go inform Shadow Phantom Commander Iris about this.

[Quest_5002]
Name=Destroy the Evil Energy
Occur_String1=I want to get out of here the first chance I get.<br>Lorencia Army Commander Leo wants you to know that the Evil Energy has formed in the Amberial Forest.
Occur_String2=The Evil Energy?<br>Since the Three-year War, the Pandemonium Demons have never showed up on the Earth,<br>too busy fighting each other.<br>Someone must have reunited them.
Occur_String3=Are you talking to yourself or to me?
Occur_String4=I'm sorry.<br>I'm Iris, the commander of the Shadow Phantom.<br>Noria relies on this Dudrin for its newk supplies. Most weapons are made of newk.
Occur_String5=We came here to investigate dwindling newk imports,<br>and have found out that the forest animals are mutating.<br>I've been looking for the cause of their mutation at the request of Commander Leo.
Occur_String6=Have you seen creatures coming out of the Evil Energy?
Occur_String7=Not only have I seen them, but I also killed some.<br>The people of this place call them the Larvas.
Occur_String8=The Larvas... They're the Demons who fought on the front line during the Three-Year War.<br>They're just an advance party.<br>You work for Leo, don't you? Could you do me a favor?
Occur_String9=I believe the Evil Energy is forming everywhere in the forest.<br>Please destroy it before it's completed or it starts letting Demons into our realm.

Doing_String=Leo is quick-tempered, but brave and upright.<br>If he weren't, he wouldn't have come to this backwater region.
Completable_String1=I've been waiting for you. Did you destroy all the Evil Energy?
Complete_String=At the request of Shadow Phantom Commander Iris, I tried to destroy the Evil Energy that was forming everywhere inside the forest, but for some reason physical force had no effect on it. Soon, an army of Demons will pour out of the Amberial Forest. I can't believe I'm getting involved in someone else's war. With no memories of my past, I'm confused by everything that happens around me.

Occur_String4=I don't remember.<br>I don't know who I am or how I got here.
Occur_String5=Maybe I could help you retrieve your memories.<br>But can you help me first?
Occur_String6=While you were gone to destroy the Evil Energy, we've discovered the cause of the animals' mutation.<br>It was the Evil Energy.
Occur_String7=What are you talking about? You said the Evil Energy was just the passage between Pandemonium and this realm.
Occur_String8=Yes, it is. And the energy it radiates has triggered Pandemonic changes in animals.<br>Those changes have already spread to the animals in the cave at the south side of the forest.
Occur_String9=Let's go get rid of those mutant animals, shall we? You go first. I'll follow you soon.
Doing_String=The mutants used to move alone, but now they're attacking Dudrin in groups. That means someone's controlling them.<br>But who?
Completable_String1=That was fun.  Except for the Devias Knights, I've never seen anyone as fast as you.<br>I'm a woman of her word.<br>I'll ask Great Sage Zakarian about you.

Complete_String=Shadow Phantom Commander Iris has found out that the Evil Energy is the cause of the animals' mutation.

Occur_String9=...<br>You're so careless. What if he finds Neria's Tears before you find him?
Occur_String10=This is the fastest way to get to the head of the Mission. Don't you agree?<br>We've wasted so much time. Meet me at the end of the waterway, stranger. There's Neria's Tears.
Doing_String=Let's move separately.<br>We'd better get to Neria's Tears before the Mission does.
Complete_String=Chaisong lifted the ward around Neria's Tears and lured the leader of the Dark Mission into the Milky Way Waterway. I eliminated the Dark Mission's Priestess Kisellos, who was guarding the end of the waterway where the Tears were stored.

Name=Leaders of a Civilization
Occur_String1=That was close.<br>Had we arrived a minute later, Zakarian would've gotten away with the Tears.<br>This was really careless of you.
Occur_String2=You've seen what the Dark Mission did in Karolsandria. How could you say that to me?
Occur_String3=I've risked my reputation as a Dracans Knight and fought my own men to catch him.
Occur_String4=I understand you had to keep it secret.<br>It would all have been for nothing if your plans had been leaked to the enemy.
Occur_String5=But I've failed to catch him at the last minute.<br>All I did was show him where to find that part of Neria's Tears.
Occur_String6=I'm sure you can keep it safe.<br>I knew Zakarian was prominent in the Mission, but I never thought he'd be the leader himself.<br>I'm going to keep following him.
Occur_String7=Go to Musai. It's a land that belongs to a race called the Kanturians.<br>They're a highly advanced civilization. Rumor has it that some strange phenomena are taking place there.<br>They have to be related somehow to the Dark Mission and Pandemonium.
Occur_String8=You're as famous here as you are everywhere else.<br>I don't like that you've helped the Coalition, but I'd love to have you on our side. What do you say?
Occur_String9=I'm sorry, but I'm not interested in taking anyone's side.<br>I just want to get rid of Zakarian and get my memories back.

Occur_String4=I'm someone who's looking for the Dark Mission. I've heard strange phenomena have been taking place here.
Occur_String5=The Dios all stopped working. All the Dios in Musai, that is.
Occur_String6=Dios?
Occur_String7=They're our combat machines. This place is inhabited by ferocious wild beasts. <br>Without Dios, our people are defenseless against their attacks.
Occur_String8=I'm worried about Estesia at the ecology investigation camp. <br>She's the daughter of our chief, and if something happens to her...
Occur_String9=I'll go check on her. I'll also get rid of some of those dangerous animals while I'm at it. <br><br>(All the machines stopped working at the same time. That can't be a coincidence.)
Doing_String=I hope Estesia is safe...
Completable_String1=Strange knight, who are you?
Complete_String=The Dios, the Kanturians' combat machines, have stopped working, and without them they are defenseless against wild animal attacks. The Kanturu guard captain was worried about his chief's daughter Estesia at the ecology investigation camp. I went to the camp to check on her and hunted dangerous-looking wild animals along the way.

Occur_String1=I saw you coming this way. You killed all those wolves without any remorse... <br>How could you be so cruel?!
Occur_String2=If I didn't kill them, they could've hurt you. The guards in the north sent me. <br>They're worried about you.
Occur_String3=I'm sorry. Thank you for saving me. <br>I'm here to understand the ecology of this place and take care of wild animals. <br>The cold weather is threatening their survival.
Occur_String4=If our Dios were still in operation, those wolves wouldn't have to be killed.<br>Poor animals...
Occur_String5=Do those Dios protect you?
Occur_String6=Yes. Dios are an indispensable part of our lives. <br>They're artificial intelligence systems that fight and do manual labor for us.
Occur_String7=Do you know why they've stopped working?
Occur_String8=Dios are fueled by energy called Pectra. <br>I think there's a problem with the Pectra base station in the south. I'd better go check that place out.
Occur_String9=You're not soldiers, and you don't have Dios to protect you. <br>Plus, you're a princess, aren't you? I'll go.
Occur_String10=Thank you. Then I'd better return to First Town and tell them the news about this place.

Completable_String1=Who is this? What's a stranger doing here?
Complete_String=Dios are an indispensable part of the Kanturu civilization. Without the artificial intelligence systems to fight and do manual labor for them, the Kanturians are panicking.

Occur_String2=Princess Estesia sent you? My apologies. Yes, it's as she said. <br>There's a problem with our Pectra energy repeaters.
Occur_String3=What can I do to help?
Occur_String4=This base station sends Pectra energy to a myriad of energy repeaters scattered across Musai, <br>forming a tight network across the region with Pectra.
Occur_String5=It's kind of like a spider web. If the Dios stopped working, it might mean the energy repeaters are having problems. <br>Dios are fueled by Pectra, you know.
Occur_String6=Could you reset the energy repeaters? Then the Dios should start working again.
Occur_String7=Alright, tell me how to reset them.
Occur_String8=First, cut off Circuits 2, 7, and 14, and then check the main panel's pressure. Change the Operating System to Closed mode. Shut down the V-9 processor. <br>And then?
Occur_String9=Forget it.
Occur_String10=W-wait!  Just pull down the blue lever on the upper side of the energy repeaters. <br>That'll reset them right away.

Complete_String=The Pectra base station releases the Pectra energy to a myriad of energy repeaters scattered across Musai, forming a tight network across the region by Pectra.

Occur_String3=This situation is serious. First Town could be in danger by now.
Occur_String4=First Town?
Occur_String5=It's the main settlement where our chief stays. <br>More soldiers are stationed there than here, but they also rely heavily on Dios.

Occur_String7=You must have many enemies. Without the Dios, you can't keep them at bay. <br>I'll go to First Town.
Occur_String8=You might encounter Gremlins on your way there. <br>They've been waiting for the Dios to disappear.

Occur_String5=Have you tried to live peacefully with other races? <br>You have all the fertile areas to yourself and that wouldn't have been possible if it weren't for the Dios.
Occur_String6=Don't patronize us, stranger. <br>If our empire didn't fall and we didn't have to live in this barren land, all the ground races, including yours, would've been under our rule by now.

Occur_String4=I reset the Pectra energy repeaters to bring them back up, but that didn't fix the problem.
Occur_String5=Fortunately, the cause has been identified. The Dios stopped working because of ice elementals. <br>We used Dios to control their population, so...
Occur_String6=So you killed them when their numbers grow. No wonder you're surrounded by so many enemies.
Occur_String7=Since Estesia prohibited the control of their population, their numbers have nearly doubled. <br>They're busy laying eggs, even as we speak.
Occur_String8=Are you saying their eggs are keeping the Dios immobile?
Occur_String9=Yes, they're colder than ice. Look how many eggs there are. <br>There are enough to freeze all the Dios' engines. They're the only explanation.

Occur_String4=...<br>What's making this Pectra energy? <br>What if there's a problem with its origin?
Occur_String5=That's impossible. Pectra is created in a fusion reactor,<br>and the reactor is located deep inside the Ice Waterfall Cave.
Occur_String6=It's guarded by Dios that have their own power supply. No one can get near it. <br>Except for me, of course, and Senior Scientist Marongo.

The Pectra fusion reactor, the origin of the Pectra energy, is situated deep inside the Glacier Waterfall Cave. Only Kalak and Marongo have access to it and it's possible that Marongo has betrayed his own kind. If I reset the fusion reactor and bring it back up, the Dios might start moving again.

Occur_String4=So you're going to the Glacier Waterfall Cave. <br>Do you mind looking for my fiancĂ©e Marongo there?
Occur_String5=Why do you think he's in there?
Occur_String6=He's always wanted to live peacefully with other races. He was never happy about how my father treated them. <br>He also didn't like how dependent we were on Pectra.
Occur_String7=He thought we should give up the Dios and share Pectra with the other races to achieve true prosperity.
Occur_String8=Father thought he was just being idealistic. <br>I think Marongo had something to do with the sudden deactivation of Dios.
Occur_String9=I don't want to believe this, but maybe he wasn't abducted by the Datans, maybe he's trying to share the fusion reactor with them.
Occur_String10=I'll look for him, but if he's a traitor, then he has to be killed.
Doing_String=Marongo... Where are you? Did you really betray us?
Complete_String=Unlike Chief Kalak, Marongo wanted to live peacefully with other races and didn't like their dependency on Pectra.

Occur_String2=Apart from you, you mean. So, what was going on in there? <br>Let me guess. Did they intensify the Pectra energy with crystals?
Occur_String3=No, it's completely the opposite. <br>They needed the Crystal Cave because the crystals perfectly block the Pectra energy.
Occur_String4=We would've never known about this if we didn't catch Adrian giving the cave to Pandemonium.
Occur_String5=They were injecting Pectra into living creatures as an experiment. <br>The cave was their secret lab.

Occur_String8=Yes... I am Mukler, the ruler of the Rift.<br>Ahahaha! Now do you recognize my power? I told you.<br>I'm very modest considering my abilities.<br>I'm also known as Humble Mukler the White.
Occur_String9=I'm so close to achieving my goal! I need a stronger, larger Rift Fragment than the ones I've used before!<br>Once I finish my research, I'll tell you about the results first. So go on and get me those fragments.

Name=Lupa's Library
Occur_String1=Hey, hey. Have you ever seen a gigantic library inside the Rift?
Occur_String2=A library? I've been to one before.<br>Well, I guess there could be more than one. After all, the Rift can connect you to a random space.
Occur_String3=Whew... you idiot.<br>The Interdimensional Rift is not completely random.<br>You think you can just travel thousands of years as you like?<br>It's nice to be stupid, huh? There's nothing wrong about the ancestor's teachings!
Occur_String4=It was a place I've never seen in my life!<br>And horribly hideous Rift energy was emanating from inside.<br>A really nasty energy.
Occur_String5=Energy from a library...? Something's going on.
Occur_String6=Exactly! You know I've been studying the Rift for a long time,<br>but I've never seen so many monsters in there.<br>They were like cockroaches...
Occur_String7=If you ever run into the library inside the Rift, check it out for me.<br>Since you're not a rookie anymore, you should be able to take care of yourself, right?

Occur_String1=Oh no... Argh!<br>Hey, aren't you a knight? I don't usually do this, but could you help me for this once?
Occur_String2=What is it?
Occur_String3=I'm a member of the Rift Research Society and I'm researching the Rift.<br>I was working on my research here in the Rift, but I was so focused that I didn't notice the watchman getting closer.
Occur_String4=It's so scary to just think about it.<br>I was able to escape, but I couldn't bring my research log.<br>Could you please retrieve it for me?
Occur_String5=What's a watchman?
Occur_String6=They guard the entrance to the Rift.<br>They are monsters that even the best trained warriors will have a hard time fighting.<br>You can avoid their eyes if you are careful enough, but I was so focused on my research...
Occur_String7=Maybe I looked too beautiful, concentrating on my work...<br>I can't believe even those heinous things fell for me...
Occur_String8=You are talking nonsense, so you must be feeling better. I'll be back.
Doing_String=The members of the Rift Research Society usually scatter around to conduct their own research.<br>So most of the data we collect is only in our research logs until we share it with everyone else.<br>There are still a lot of things that I haven't shared on my log. Please find it for me.
Completable_String1=The watchman had it.
Completable_String2=Did you defeat the watchman?<br>You must be very strong! Thank you for bringing back my research log.

Occur_String1=What should I do... He should've come out a long time ago...<br>Excuse me... are you a mercenary?
Occur_String2=Let's say I'm a contract knight, for now.<br>What is it?
Occur_String3=My brother is in there... uh, that place is called the Rift... so...
Occur_String4=I know. I went inside there a few times.
Occur_String5=R-really? Could I ask for a favor then?<br>The Research Society's rule is to not request this kind of favors, but...<br>Since you've been inside...
Occur_String6=My brother is inside and hasn't come out yet..<br>We went together to find someone else...<br>There are a lot of monsters, so I'm worried that something might have happened.
Occur_String7=There's a rule like that in your Research Society? It looked like the others didn't care at all...<br>Anyway... how did you come out?
Occur_String8=The Rift is filled with energy that was created when time and space warped.<br>It's called the Rift energy, and if you are exposed to it for a long time, you will experience changes in your body and mind.<br>My brother saw my condition and told me to come out first.
Occur_String9=We don't have time... Knight! My brother might be affected by the Rift energy.<br>Please find my brother!
Doing_String=I'm sorry to rush you... but we really don't have much time...<br>Could you please hurry and save my brother?
Completable_String1=Huh...? Y-you are a knight! How did you come here?
Completable_String2=Your sister Grande asked me to find you.<br>I didn't know you were Grande's brother... I feel like I will continue to see you around...
Completable_String3=What are you doing here? She said you came to look for someone.
Completable_String4=Y-yes... I came to find Mukler...
Completable_String5=Mukler? He didn't go to you? I told him you were looking for him.
Completable_String6=What? H-he didn't come... That's why I came to f-find him.<br>K-knight...! C-could you please ch-check if Mukler is here?
Completable_String7=M-my body can't withstand this any longer... s-so I will have to leave!<br>I'm nauseous... guh...!

Doing_String=G-Grande must be worried. L-let's go out. I'd better hurry...
Completable_String1=There you are, Knight! I was worried that you might not come out! <br>My brother told me you saved him!
Completable_String2=I sent him first to go take a rest!<br>He was inside the Rift for too long, so he looked very tired.<br>I'm not sure how to repay you... It's not much, but please take this!

Occur_String2=W-what are you doing, all of a sudden! Wait! I said, wait! Hey, wait! <br>Listen to me! You have to tell me the reason first!
Occur_String3=Why didn't you go to Venti? Didn't you say you'll go if I helped you?<br>You just used me, huh. Do I look that easy?
Occur_String4=Fine! I'll go! I had a reason! Don't rush me, rookie!<br>I have a lot going on right now!
Occur_String5=Yes! How about you go inside? Inside the Rift right in front of us.<br>If you find any suspicious creature, you let me know.<br>I think I'll go crazy if I meet him again.
Occur_String6=What are you saying? Are you okay?
Occur_String7=...You have to do it for me! Go inside the Rift and eliminate them all!<br>Even the watchman. And if you see anything, you have to let me know!
Occur_String8=Then, promise me. That you'll go to Venti.<br>He almost died looking for you.
Occur_String9=I got it! You can't trust me?<br>If I wasn't so disturbed, you'd have been transformed into a mouse! <br>Huh? What's up with those fists?

Completable_String2=I see... Maybe I saw wrong. I mistook it for something else!<br>Now I feel better. We'll meet again, rookie!

[Quest_8104]
Name=Dangerous Rift
Occur_String1=Hello! Thank you for saving my brother before.
Occur_String2=Like I said last time, if you stay in the Rift for a long time, you'll be exposed to the Rift energy.<br>At first you'll just feel dizzy, but eventually your body will mutate and you'll be stuck in the Rift.<br>In other words... you'll become a monster.
Occur_String3=Us at the Rift Research Society have to be careful since we go in and out of the Rift frequently.<br>That's why we consider even a little dizziness very dangerous.<br>I'm glad that you found my brother fast.
Occur_String4=The problem is that I've started to feel dizzy, so I'm careful about going inside the Rift.<br>That's why I was wondering if you could go inside the Rift for me?
Occur_String5=Of course, the Rift Research Society will reward you.<br>Since you were able to rescue my brother Venti from there, I believe your skills will be very helpful to our research on the Rift.
Occur_String6=If you are rewarding me, it's not a problem.
Occur_String7=Thank you, Knight. Please go inside the Rift next to me.<br>We should first find out how long you can stay inside the Rift.
Doing_String=Hmm... I must do the research, but my body is not strong enough. Phew... it's so hard...
Completable_String1=How are you? Do you feel okay?<br>If there's anything out of place, please tell me your condition.
Completable_String2=I don't know... I don't feel anything. I don't feel nauseous or dizzy.
Completable_String3=Amazing! If I had been in there for as long as you were, I would have lost consciousness.<br>I will have to check the information from the Rift Research Society and see if there are any other cases like yours.<br>Thank you, Knight. We'll continue our talk when we meet again.
Complete_String=I can stay inside the Rift for as long as I want without feeling the deadly effects that almost immediately affect everyone else. Once again, who am I?

[Quest_8105]
Name=Rift Exposure
Occur_String1=I looked at various files of the Rift Research Society, but we haven't done much research. I don't know how someone like you exists.<br>Hm... very interesting. There hasn't been anyone who has been exposed to the Rift energy for that long that hasn't suffered any damage...
Occur_String2=There's one arrogant genius in our Rift Research Society, and maybe he's the only one who could explain your unique... durability? or something like that.
Occur_String3=And... I have no idea how long you could withstand the Rift energy...<br>Even though I thought I had done a lot of research.
Occur_String4=Well, don't be discouraged. Maybe I'm just one strange species.
Occur_String5=That's right! If I get discouraged, nothing will be solved. So, Knight!
Occur_String6=Hm?
Occur_String7=Please fight as many monsters as possible inside the Rift! Hmm... about 100 of them?<br>Then I'll be able to quantify your resistance to the Rift energy!<br>Now! Good luck! You are the best!
Occur_String8=...Come on. You switched so fast...
Doing_String=If I was as strong as you, I would have stomped on Mukler a long time ago... what a pity...
Completable_String1=I'm back. There were strange monsters in the Rift. Do you know where they are from?
Completable_String2=Probably the past, or the future. Or maybe they are the monsters that existed or will exist in places we don't know about.<br>The Rift is a place like that.
Completable_String3=Please wait. I'll check your body's response.<br>.. Hm..<br>Okay. I'll tell you the details next time. I need time to analyze this.
Complete_String=Once again I explored the Rift for Grande, and I didn't feel any different from the last time. I don't know how reputable the Rift Research Society is, but it swears that I'm a rare case study.

[Quest_8106]
Name=Powerful Warp
Occur_String1=I got the results from the analysis, and it turns out you are very strong.<br>You went to the Rift but you only got this much exposure.<br>If I was this strong, I could do so much more research for the Rift Research Society...
Occur_String2=Don't be too disappointed. We just do what we can.<br>If there's anything you can't do, you just ask others.<br>Do you want me to help you with your research a little more?
Occur_String3=Really? Then I'll count on your body. Let's go inside a Rift with more powerful warps!
Occur_String4=Rifts with powerful warps have even greater Rift energy, so one can't stay in there long at all.<br>We've only done very fragmented research until now, but with your strong body, you should have no problem!
Occur_String5=So, I just need to stay there until I feel dizzy?
Occur_String6=No. Just do the same. It's just that you are going into a Rift with more powerful warps.<br>If you go and stay longer on purpose, the conditions of the research will be different so it won't be objective.
Occur_String7=Then, please go. I'll be preparing some things while waiting.
Doing_String=I never thought I would meet someone who could withstand the atmosphere inside the Rift Warp.

[Quest_8107]
Name=Grande's Recommendation
Occur_String1=Knight! I'm sorry I had to leave like that last time.
Occur_String2=What is it? It looked like you were going to other Rifts before then too...
Occur_String3=As you saw, the Rifts are in various regions, and the places that are connected to them are all different.<br>That's why the Rift Research Society goes from region to region to do research.
Occur_String4=That's why the people at the Rift Research Society are all scattered.<br>It's because we want to see the Rifts in various regions.
Occur_String5=I was able to do a lot of research thanks to your strong body.<br>Once I finish this investigation, I should be able to settle the research that is being conducted outside.<br>Taking the data found outside and confirming it inside is a little easier.
Occur_String6=I see. You better rest some, like Venti.
Occur_String7=Phew... That's right. Exposure to the Rift energy is very dangerous.<br>I should rest when I can.<br>I have to recharge to continue my research!
Occur_String8=So, what do I need to do this time?
Occur_String9=There is nothing special.<br>You just need to go to a Rift with even stronger warps than last time.<br>Now! You go!
Doing_String=I'll be waiting, Knight! We're almost there!
Completable_String1=Oh, are you okay? You look tired. The Rift shouldn't be underestimated.<br>But thanks to you, I'll be able to go back sooner than I thought!
Completable_String2=I'll recommend you to the Rift Research Society since you've helped me so much!<br>You've already helped other researchers, so there shouldn't be a problem.<br>Come find the Rift Research Society in Ohrdor! It's to the east of Ohrdor.<br>It's hard to find, so look at the walls carefully!
Complete_String=Grande says she'll recommend me to the Rift Research Society. It looks like a place with a lot of strange people... but there's nothing wrong with getting close to them, so I'll go find them in Ohrdor.

Occur_String4=The monsters in the Rift all have essences of their own. I'm thinking that those essences are what lets them live in there.
Occur_String5=I'm sure that the strong monsters who live in more warped Rifts have stronger essences.<br>Well, I'm sure you know what I mean by now.<br>Oh, don't worry. You'll get a good reward! Please head out now.
Occur_String6=Darn it. She got me...
Doing_String=The monsters in the Rift have a very strong life force!<br>If we can use only some part of that force, we might be able to see some great effects.
Completable_String1=These were inside their bodies.
Completable_String2=Thank you, Knight!<br>If this really is the source of their mysterious life force, it will sell for a lot.<br>Even if it doesn't sell, I could use it on my skin... Oh!<br>You didn't hear me say that, okay? You didn't!

Completable_String3=Oh, they are so beautiful! Knight! What color do you think this is?<br>Red? Blue? No. It's shining gold!

Occur_String5=Yes. We found a book inside the Rift, that allows its reader to enter its world. Isn't that amazing?

Occur_String2=The Dance of Ice and Lava?
Occur_String3=It's a novel about an eternal war between the Frozen Soul Queen, Avalanchera, and a monster with lava running in his veins, Naklokhan. I liked it.<br>I thought it was just an ordinary novel, so I shelved it away after reading it once.<br>I couldn't have been more wrong.
Occur_String4=Then one day, two Rifts suddenly opened around the book! That alone is surprising enough, but to top it off, they were connected to<br>the world of the book. Can you believe that? They've connected a fictitious world to reality!
Occur_String5=One of the Rifts is connected to the Ice Demon Cave, where Avalanchera resides; and the other, to Naklokhan's Fire Demon Cave.<br>Geez, I've never seen anything like this before. Everyone dreams of exploring the world of a book once or twice, right? That dream has come true!

Doing_String=I love novels and stories.<br>Mm, maybe I should leave a couple of books in the Rift, like Pierre Pan or Princess Charming. Who knows?<br>You think I'm being silly, but I'd love to meet those characters.
Completable_String1=Have you met them? They're the agents of Avalanchera and Naklokhan. They need help to get rid of each other.<br>What I want you to do is to help them, so you can explore the Ice Demon Cave and the Fire Demon Cave.
Completable_String2=And take this. You need these Sage's Stones to enter the places. Without them... nothing will happen.<br>I'm sorry, I can only give you one.
Completable_String3=I've heard they're found from alchemized artifacts. My society is currently trying to figure out why nothing happens without Sage's Stones, and why these stones are found only from alchemized artifacts.<br>But it's difficult: the alchemy merchant wouldn't talk.
Completable_String4=That geezer hardly talks. All right, I'll go.<br>By the way, do you know they're not humans? I think they're elementals of some sort.
Completable_String5=They're not? Then again, they came out of the Rifts, from a fictitious world.<br>It's not surprising that they're different from us. I'll look into them. Thanks.
Complete_String=I have to explore the world within a book called the Dance of Ice and Lava while helping the agents of the book characters, Avalanchera and Naklokhan. The world of a book. I can't wait to see!

Name=Chill Knights
Occur_String1=You're a brave follower of Naklokhan's, aren't you?
Occur_String2=No, I'mâ€”<br>(Wait, maybe I shouldn't say no.)<br>*Ahem* Yes. I follow Naklokhan blazing with hot flames.
Occur_String3=Ah, then you know your destiny, don't you?<br>Go destroy Queen Avalanchera's crystals and melt everything else in Naklokhan's name!
Occur_String4=W-well... I'm a fairly new follower.<br>Could you tell me more about my destiny?
Occur_String5=Ah, all right then. Listen up. The queen split her soul into 8 pieces and froze them in crystals made of perpetual ice. She keeps them hidden inside her cave.<br>She can't be killed unless the crystals containing her soul are destroyed.
Occur_String6=To get her soul, you first must defeat the Chill Knights who protect her. Then, her crystals will weaken and yield her soul pieces.
Occur_String7=What do the Knights have to do with the crystals?
Occur_String8=The Chill Knights are the personification of the cold energy her soul exhales.<br>The more damage you inflict on the Knights, the more cold energy her soul crystals have to generate. Eventually the crystals have no energy left to protect her soul within.
Doing_String=By the way, it seems as if you just started serving Naklokhan. You're as ignorant as a babe.
Completable_String1=Good job defeating so many Chill Knights.<br>Now her crystals will have to use the energy that they've reserved for her soul's protection to restore the Knights.
Complete_String=The Ice Demon Cave is not as cold as before. Getting rid of the Chill Knights really must affect the power of Queen Avalanchera's soul. Now, can I touch her soul crystals?

Occur_String2=Find soul crystals in the Ice Demon Cave and bring her frozen soul to me. Make sure you have all her soul pieces.<br>Leave one behind, and she will continue to live, however weak she is.
Occur_String3=I've seen quite a few soul crystals here and there. Does every one of them contain a piece of her soul?
Occur_String4=Queen Avalanchera created many crystals, some of them containing her soul, some of them containing only cold energy. To fool us!<br>We won't know which one contains which, until we touch them. Their freezing energy disguises what they contain.
Occur_String5=Also her soul pieces constantly move from one crystal to another, which makes it all the more difficult to catch them.<br>But our mission is clear: watch Naklokhan slowly burn and dedicate ourselves to him!
Occur_String6=...<br>(He's saying I have to touch each and every single crystal. Darn it!)
Doing_String=Don't worry. Naklokhan will not forget your dedication to him.

Occur_String2=Erm... With passionate faith in Naklokhan?
Occur_String3=That's a wonderful answer! But it's only half accurate.<br>To melt her frozen soul, we need a strong hatred for her. It'll melt this frozen soul as quickly and completely as boiling lava would a block of ice!
Occur_String4=Many soldiers are held captive inside her frozen cave. They lost everything, and they're nothing but bony puppets doing the queen's bidding.<br>What you have to do this time is collect their grudges against Queen Avalanchera.
Doing_String=Why is your answer only half accurate? Everything we do requires faith in Naklokhan.

Occur_String2=Warrior of Great Naklokhan, this will be your last mission.<br>Bring Queen Avalanchera to a fiery end, and bring her glacial crystal as proof of her death.

Occur_String2=That's not whyâ€”<br>(Mm, maybe I shouldn't say no.)<br>That's right. I want to at least throw a bucket of ice cold water at Naklokhan.
Occur_String3=Ho ho. You're funny. Queen Avalanchera would love to hear that.<br>To kill Naklokhan, you have to destroy his lava heart, the essence of his fire. But this essence, unless it's near another essence of similar properties, does not reveal itself.
Occur_String4=How can I get this essence?
Occur_String5=You first need Holy Grails of Fire to contain his essence. Those lowly fanatics that worship Naklokhan carry them, but they never show them except when they make Burning Zombies.
Occur_String6=Get rid of those zombies swarming the Fire Demon Cave, and the fanatics will have to produce their Holy Grails of Fire to make more zombies. That's when you strike.

Occur_String1=These Holy Grails of Fire are made out of lava by Naklokhan. That's why they're perfect to contain his dirty, sticky, and disgusting hot essence.
Occur_String2=What you have to do now is simple: punish his fanatic followers and seize their Holy Grails of Fire.<br>We need as many Holy Grails as the number of hearts that Naklokhan has.
Occur_String3=You blessed subjects of Queen Avalanchera cannot do this because you're too cold. Is that right?
Occur_String4=You're smart. We're the children of Queen Avalanchera, who is the cold shine of the glacier given life and form.<br>It's inefficient for us to collect Holy Grails of Fire or collect his essence.<br>It's also beneath Queen Avalanchera.

Occur_String2=But %s_9_1, you eliminated Queen Avalanchera and Naklokhan, and that must have caused an error in the agents. Because neither of them dies in the novel.<br>You said you didn't think their agents were real people. Remember?

Occur_String2=Anyway, I think if there's nothing at the end of the tower, I will want to deal with you first.<br>I feel like you are just making me do dangerous things, calling them tests and tasks...
Occur_String3=Huh...? W-what do you mean...? It's not like that.<br>And there must be something at the end of such an enormous tower.
Occur_String4=And I do wish to see what lies at the end of your challenge, or the tower itself.<br>For you, climbing past floor 15 should be an appropriate challenge at the moment.

Occur_String1=I had a dream recently... A great knight climbed to the top of the Endless Tower,<br>and was greeted by the great god Rugard...<br>And I could feel this strange energy coming out from the knight...
Occur_String2=Perhaps the knight refers to you?
Occur_String3=I don't care about your interpretation of your dreams.<br>And if I conquer the Endless Tower, I won't be having tea time with Rugard.
Occur_String4=Oh... You never know what kind of results are waiting at the end.<br>It's all in the hands of the great gods above.
Occur_String5=But your challenge is very interesting.<br>Here's your final test. Will you accept the challenge?
Doing_String=Oh, great Rugard, please bless the future of that strange knight...
Completable_String1=I can only guide you as far as here.<br>Now it's up to you to continue.<br>I hope you meet the brilliant gods from the heaven.
Complete_String=I passed Rapiella's final test. She said she could only guide me as far as here, and prayed that I could climb higher.

Occur_String2=Why is that?
Occur_String3=You know... the things that can't be explained by anything other than god's power...<br>Phew, this piece of architecture is truly unbelievable.
Occur_String4=All knights train at the brink of death in order to obtain the power to protect themselves.<br>Of course, you are not a knight, but I believe your spirit is the same.<br>Can you really say you risked your life for your research?
Occur_String5=You're right.<br>I see your point... I'm not risking my life or anything...<br>I was too discouraged.<br>Thank you! I will pull myself together and find out everything about the tower!
Occur_String6=In order to proceed with my research, I need to get more definite data!<br>The powerful rulers of the Endless Tower! I need the Essences of strong monsters!
Doing_String=There are many things in the world that cannot be explained scientifically...<br>The Endless Tower... the Blood Castle... and the power of gods.
Completable_String1=If it wasn't for you, I would've given up on my research.<br>I'll have to research my whole life just to look into what you've told me and brought back for me.

Occur_String1=Welcome! How have you been?
Occur_String2=How have I been? Don't act like you don't know. I know you've got eyes and ears everywhere on the continent!
Occur_String3=Hah hah hah... So you know. I was just saying that as a pleasantry! Don't be upset.
Occur_String4=Forget the pleasantries. Why did you want to see me?
Occur_String5=Ah! See the massive tower being built near the Room of Duty? Lately, I've been putting my heart and soul into it, and I need your help.
Occur_String6=What are you up to this time? I can never tell what you're thinking.
Occur_String7=I'm not up to anything. But you know the Pandemonium Army has its eye on MU. It's only a matter of time before it decides to invade and devastate our continent.
Occur_String8=I'm building this tower to prepare for times like that. Kyle can tell you more about it.<br>For now, please go to the tower's construction manager, Duropan. He's having some kind of problem.
Occur_String9=You're building a tower with Silver Sparrowhawk Kyle and airship craftsman Duropan... What in blazes are you making?

Name=Stability Test
Occur_String1=I'm sure you saw the massive size of the Tower of Dawn on your way here.
Occur_String2=As you know, I'm a dwarf specializing in airships. I never had much interest in buildings until Kundun showed me the blueprints of this tower. Embodying the essence of manatech, this tower has a more elaborate structure than an airship.
Occur_String3=Suddenly, it hit me that I was the only dwarf skilled enough to build this tower. Durov is too stupid and incompetent to do it.
Occur_String4=With a heavy sense of responsibility, I started building this tower. And I completed it at last.<br>It's hard to believe how magnificent it is, even as you look at it now, huh?
Occur_String5=You're rambling.<br>So, what's up? Why did you call me out here?
Occur_String6=I'd like you to do me the honor of being the first one to enter the Tower of Dawn. No one has ever climbed it yet. Say, don't you want the honor?<br>You're more than qualified for it. You're strong enough to cope with whatever technical mishaps that might happen inside the tower. Kwa hah hah!
Occur_String7=...<br>So, you want me to check if the tower is functioning normally. But what actually goes on in the tower?
Occur_String8=You got me! Kwa hah hah! Kyle can tell you more about the tower. But just climb it for now, will you?<br>I'm so excited. I built it according to the blueprints, but it's so complicated... I don't know if it's going to work as intended.
Doing_String=If I knew it'd be so tough, I would've asked Durov for help. My pride will be my undoing...<br>Never mind. I was just talking to myself.
Completable_String1=You came back in one piece. The Tower of Dawn is functioning normally!<br>Say, how did you like experiencing the skills of the genius Duropan firsthand? Kwa hah hah!
Complete_String=I tested the Tower of Dawn at Duropan's request.

Name=Manatech Driver
Occur_String1=What in blazes is this tower? It has monsters from everywhere... Enova, Noria, and even Pandemonium! It's bizarre!
Occur_String2=Kwa hah hah! I told you, it's the embodiment of the essence of manatech by Duropan. And you haven't even seen half of it.<br>You can ask Kyle about the monsters in the tower later. For now, be prepared for more surprises.
Occur_String3=Now that we confirmed the stability of the Tower of Dawn system, it's time we experience the essence of manatech.<br>Hey, could you show me your Talismans?
Occur_String4=Sure, I can show you.<br>W-wait! Please don't touch them. They're precious to me.
Occur_String5=I didn't know you were so petty about such things. Don't worry. I wasn't going to touch them, anyway.<br>The reason the Tower of Dawn is known as the "Embodiment of the Essence of Manatech" has to do with the Talismans.
Occur_String6=The principle of the Talismans has been realized in this tower. I've named it the Manatech Driver!<br>Still being in its early stages, its power is not as destructive as the Talismans, and it can only be used inside the Tower, but it's still an amazing discovery.
Occur_String7=Of course, I only implemented it. Kundun did all the research and designâ€”ah, with Etramu's help. Kyle can tell you more about this, too. Get it?
Occur_String8=Kundun... This explains the confidence I saw in his face when he sent me here.
Occur_String9=In addition to the Manatech Driver, the Tower of Dawn is also equipped with a system that enables you to climb multiple stages at once, depending on your performance. This concludes the explanation. Why don't you give it a try? Please enter the Tower of Dawn and clear at least 3 floors in one go.
Doing_String=Ah! Use the Manatech Driver to check the system.
Completable_String1=Ahem. %s_9_1, did you climb 3 floors of the Tower of Dawn at one time?<br>I'm curious. Everyone has been waiting for you.

Name=Kundun and the Silver Sparrowhawks
Occur_String1=Now that we know everything's working properly, it's safe to say the Tower of Dawn is completed.
Occur_String2=Wait, my question first. What's this tower for, really?
Occur_String3=Hm, hm. You must be dying to know.<br>The Tower of Dawn is a sort of training ground that combines the knowledge of us Silver Sparrowhawks with the manatech of the Mediah Kingdom.
Occur_String4=The continuous activities of the Dark Mission, the Evil Energy Tunnel in Litenberg, and the forces of darkness that threatened Queen Cara... They all indicate that Pandemonium has its eye on the MU continent, and it's only a matter of time before it decides to invade.
Occur_String5=That's why Kundun and Etramu joined forces and recruited the dwarf craftsmen to create this tower.<br>Oh, right! Etramu doesn't like being the center of attention. Let's keep his involvement secret, shall we?
Occur_String6=Hm, hm. Anyway, all the monsters that appear in this tower are illusions based on the information we have. But make no mistake, they're just as dangerous as their original selves.
Occur_String7=A training ground created in preparation for Pandemonium's invasion, a place filled with fierce monsters... That's the Tower of Dawn!
Occur_String8=I don't think that's all this place is for. Kundun said Pandemonium's invasion will devastate the MU continent. I think he has a hidden agenda.
Occur_String9=Well... I told you everything I know. I'm just a member of a big group. I'm not privy to everything that Kundun might have in mind. Anyway, %s_9_1, please climb the tower and fight the monsters in there.
Doing_String=Most monsters in the Tower of Dawn should be familiar to you. Please check if there's any difference between these replicas and their originals.

Occur_String3=And you'll be fighting those monsters on the fifteenth and higher floors, %s_9_1.
Occur_String4=Pandemonium monsters recreated from ancient tomes and documents, huh? I'm excited to see them.

Occur_String2=Not yet, but I have a long way to go before I reach the top.<br>This tower is definitely helping me grow.
Occur_String3=Absolutely! From Kundun to us Silver Sparrowhawks and the airship craftsmen, everyone involved in the construction of the Tower of Dawn worked hard, and we're proud of the results.
Occur_String4=Now your goal is the twenty-fifth floor. The twenty-fifth and higher floors feature many named monsters that are real terrors throughout the continent. They're tougher than the floors below. Please be careful.

Completable_String1=What? You're finished already?<br>Incredible! You've climbed at least thirty floors of the Tower of Dawn! Etramu will be surprised, too.
Completable_String2=Etramu doesn't like to be in the spotlight, but he's been instrumental in the construction of the Tower of Dawn. He's the leader of the Mediah Manatech Association as well as the Watcher of Pandemonium, who keeps an eye on the Manatech Abyss.
Completable_String3=The Watcher of Pandemonium?<br>That explains how you were able to replicate the Pandemonium monsters with almost zero information.
Completable_String4=Correct. What's more important is that Etramu, while monitoring the Manatech Abyss, discovered that the Pandemonium Demons have begun moving after a long period of inactivity. This means they're getting ready to invade.
Completable_String5=The Tower of Dawn is the result of our efforts to overtake them. For now, it's a training ground to cultivate soldiers against them, but later...<br>...Never mind. That's all you need to know for now. Don't worry about it, though. You'll be the first one to know when the time is right.

Occur_String5=No matter how deep the wound may be, a god's soul slowly recovers in the stream of the universe and regains its powers in the end.<br>Although it may take an unimaginable time...
Occur_String6=But recently, the Crusaders have become more violent, and Anilata's soul has been recovering at a very fast pace...<br>Which is why we must gather our strength to continuously interrupt Anilata.
Occur_String7=You mean we're like moths flying into fire?<br>Trying to wound a god's soul?
Occur_String8=I wouldn't say that. If we can work together to damage a god's soul...<br>Isn't that a great achievement too?
Occur_String9=We're running out of time. We'll talk more later...<br>The battlefield awaits you.
Occur_String10=The Blood Castle is now your stage...<br>I will wait for news of your triumph.
Doing_String=You are already famous amongst the knights that have joined the Blood Castle expedition.
Completable_String1=Amazing! This fast...?<br>The Crusaders probably didn't even know they were dying!
Complete_String=I stormed the Blood Castle, only to find out I can't fight Anilata just yet. But I will continue this fight. If I give up now, I'll be giving up on my future.
List_String=I have to storm the Blood Castle and prevent Anilata's full resurrection.
Mission_String=Conquer the Blood Castle within 7 minutes
Mission_Target1=Conquer the Blood Castle

[Quest_9108]
Name=Crusader 3
Occur_String1=The plans you brought us contained these words.<br>Dullahan, proceed with the ritual, cooperation, and resurrection...
Occur_String2=It looks like they are going to have a ritual for revival. Anilata's revival, of course.<br>And they are asking for cooperation with the ritual...
Occur_String3=Especially, this... Dullahan. Doesn't it sound like a name?<br>If you ever meet an enemy named Dullahan inside the Blood Castle, don't let him pass!<br>We might find a clue.
Occur_String4=Dullahan... Okay. That name sounds somewhat disturbing. I'll look for him.
Occur_String5=And having a ritual to revive someone reminds me of them...
Doing_String=Dullahan... cooperation...<br>The Crusaders must have conspired with some outside force.<br>Who would possibly work with them...?
Completable_String1=You really met Dullahan?<br>And that's...? Secret orders?<br>Please give it to me! I'll take a close look.
Complete_String=I found Dullahan and seized the secret orders he had. I hope there's something in there that will help us defeat them.

[Quest_9109]
Name=Crusader 4
Occur_String1=No... no... Impossible...<br>A terrible secret has been revealed from the secret orders.
Occur_String2=The Crusaders are working with Pandemonium to resurrect Anilata through a ritual.<br>I was wondering how the Crusaders have grown in numbers lately...<br>I can't believe they're working with Pandemonium...
Occur_String3=Dullahan is an alliance commander deployed from Pandemonium.<br>It looks like the Pandemonium forces are able to rapidly restore Anilata's soul.
Occur_String4=Now that Anilata has teamed up with Pandemonium, the full recovery of Anilata<br>will throw this world into an unprecedented state of chaos.
Occur_String5=But I wonder what kind of magic or technique of Pandemonium is making Anilata resurrect sooner...<br>Have you seen anything strange inside the Blood Castle?
Occur_String6=I did see something out of place.<br>A coffin made out of crystals.<br>It looks like Anilata was inside that coffin.
Occur_String7=The Crystal Coffin! I heard that some lights shoot up from the Blood Castle sometimes.<br>If those lights come from the Crystal Coffin, and it has to do with Anilata's resurrection...
Occur_String8=Please find some clues from the Crystal Coffin.<br>We must find out exactly what the Crystal Coffin is!
Doing_String=Great Rugard... Please bless us in our war.
Completable_String1=What's this? This thing is emitting dreadful Pandemonic energy...<br>This is from the Crystal Coffin?
Completable_String2=I'll look into it. Thank you for your work, Knight.
Complete_String=I obtained Corrupted Crystal Fragment from the Crystal Coffin in the Blood Castle.
List_String=I have to find clues about Anilata's resurrection in the Crystal Coffin inside Blood Castle.
Mission_String=Obtain Infected Crystal Fragment from the Crystal Coffin in the Blood Castle
Mission_Target1=Infected Crystal Fragment

[Quest_9110]
Name=Crusader 5
Occur_String1=The Corrupted Crystal Fragment you brought... is something worse than I thought.
Occur_String2=That crystal indiscriminately absorbs all energy from around.<br>Even life forces and souls.<br>If one is exposed to this Pandemonium crystal for long, they might grow weak and even die.
Occur_String3=The Crystal Coffin was transferring the energy obtained like that to Anilata.<br>Anilata... is trying to resurrect by sacrificing his own Crusaders.<br>And that by using the power of Pandemonium!
Occur_String4=Anilata... I heard he used to be the defender of Akneria. He's the type I hate.<br>Those who use their followers for what they want...
Occur_String5=Knight! Anilata shouldn't have resurrected completely yet.<br>This is our chance to stop him!<br>Please defeat Anilata in the Blood Castle!
Doing_String=Rugard! Please give us the courage to defeat Anilata!
Completable_String1=You are amazing, Knight. You defeated Anilata!<br>You are the disciple of hope that Rugard has sent us!
Completable_String2=But as mere creations, we have no way of eliminating Anilata.<br>We... can only put him in a deep sleep.<br>But if we don't do that... Then we'll all be doomed.<br>This war just got started, and it will continue on.
Complete_String=I succeeded in defeating Anilata, who wasn't completely resurrected yet, and resealed him. But we are mere creations. We can't kill him, since he was created by Akneria herself. This fight will continue on. Forever...
List_String=I have to defeat Anilata who hasn't completely resurrected yet and reseal him.

Mission_Target1=Reseal Anilata

[Quest_9111]
Name=A Dead End
Occur_String1=My rift research has hit a dead end. I need new inspiration! Ideas that, like, hit you like a lightning or something.
Occur_String2=Slump?
Occur_String3=Slump? Bah! No slump will dare come to me! You don't know what you're talking about! I'm too great and smart to go through a slump!<br>I am... just in between ideas. A great scholar like me looks for ways to fill this hiatus with more academic pursuits.<br>That's the way of a man dedicated to science!
Occur_String4=Hm... Speaking of which, I saw you enter the Blood Castle. What is that place?
Occur_String5=It's strange place encamped by so-called Crusaders. They tried to invade this area, so I took care of them.
Occur_String6=A strange place? Hm... So it's linked with another dimension or space? Good.
Occur_String7=Hey, I need you to probe the Blood Castle. Bring me anything that looks important.<br>Oh, don't give me that why should I look! Have I ever made you do anything for free?
Doing_String=It's gonna be fun. I can feel it.
Completable_String1=Let's see what you have found!<br>Don't need this... Not this... Didn't I say important?<br>Not this one, either... Nope... Hm? Oh, you can just throw that away.<br>I suppose that castle is not so special after... Hm?
Completable_String2=Hm... Will you look at this!<br>A crystal that holds both holy and pandemonic power... How is this possible?
Completable_String3=Is that normal?
Completable_String4=Not exactly. Usually, one overwhelms the other. That's what happens when you say purification or corruption.<br>When holy power prevails, it's purification. When it's the other way round, it's corruption.<br>But the two co-exist in this crystal. But how?
Completable_String5=Tell me more about those Crusaders. I need more details than they are bad guys.
Complete_String=While rummaging through what I found in the Blood Castle, Mukler was deeply impressed with a crystal. He said it had both holy and pandemonic power, which should be impossible. Judging from the look on his face, he must have hit a gold mine.
List_String=Mukler, whose rift research had hit a dead end, asked me to probe the Blood Castle. It's a slump all right. Anyway, I have to scan the castle for anything that looks important.
Mission_String=Probe the Blood Castle at Mukler's request
Mission_Target1=Probe Blood Castle

[Quest_9112]
Name=Astonishing Crystal
Occur_String1=So, Akneria joining is forces with demons and fighting Rugard and Bulcan... That's weird.<br>Akneria was destroyed by Sekneum, which means they are now in league with the one who killed their master. What are they thinking?
Occur_String2=Well, your story gave me an idea. I need to look into it further.<br>Meanwhile, I need you to bring me more powerful crystals. Try beating up some high rankers in the castle.
Doing_String=That should work... I think.
Completable_String1=Alright. These crystals definitely have more power. This will help me make some progress in my rift research.
Completable_String2=And here's my idea on how these crystals came to be.<br>Despite his demon status, Sekneum originated from Akneria. So are the Crusaders.<br>That is why they can embrace the Pandemonic energy. They share the same origin.
Completable_String3=But how come they're not corrupted? Other than them, I've never seen any being who can resist that power.
Completable_String4=They are simply too strong to be affected. Crusaders are Akneria's personal creation and guardians. Corrupting such beings would require Sekneum himself.<br>Different power, same origin. That is why these Crusaders, created by the god of creation himself, can be a vessel capable of holding both power.
Complete_String=The Crusaders are Akneria's personal guards. Since the pandemonic power originates from Akneria, Crusaders can wield both holy and pandemonic power. That explains how they could join forces with demons. They don't care about the means, as long as they get the result.
List_String=While Mukler does his research on the Crusaders, I should bring back more powerful crystals than before.
Mission_String=Collect more powerful crystals for Mukler
Mission_Target1=Powerful Crystal

[Quest_9113]
Name=Ultimate Crystals 1
Occur_String1=So, are these the best crystals you could find in the Blood Castle? Isn't there anyone more powerful, like their boss?
Occur_String2=The Crusaders are led by someone called Anilata. He is building up his power in a crystal coffin.<br>Do you need his crystal?
Occur_String3=Is that a trick question? I need you to get Anilata's crystal for me.<br>Such potent power must have some interesting applications.
Doing_String=What? You can't fight Anilata right now? Oh, that's disappointing.
Completable_String1=Is this the one? It looks promising. Well, well...<br>Hm? This is too weak! This is not what I expected. Is this really from Anilata?
Complete_String=I took Anilata's crystal to Mukler, but he was not impressed. Well, I too have felt the crystal was not as potent as I expected... But what was the problem?
List_String=Mukler wants me to find the ultimate crystal for his research. Anilata's crystal... That should be the most powerful crystal in the Blood Castle.
Mission_String=Collect the ultimate crystal for Mukler
Mission_Target1=Anilata's Crystal

[Quest_9114]
Name=Ultimate Crystals 2
Occur_String1=But there's no reason for you to lie. This could only mean one thing. Anilata used the power in his crystal as they fight went on.<br>Can you get me the crystal faster?
Occur_String2=How fast?
Occur_String3=Hm... four minutes? Can you do it?
Occur_String4=Just wait here.
Doing_String=I will. Don't disappoint me!
Completable_String1=Yes, this looks more like it. Studying rifts requires massive energy. It's no mean feat to secure that much energy.<br>If I can harness the power in the crystal... it should be fun.
Complete_String=I delivered a fully charged Anilata's crystal to Mukler.
List_String=I have to defeat Anilata before he uses the crystal's power, and then bring the crystal back. Mukler thinks beating him in four minutes should do it.
Mission_String=Clear the Blood Castle before Anilata uses up the crystal's power
Mission_Target1=Clear the Blood Castle under 4 minutes.

[Quest_9115]
Name=The Vessel for the Crystals
Occur_String1=Special crystals need special vessels for safe research.<br>Will you bring me some materials to craft the chests?
Occur_String2=That was random. Bring you what? From where?
Occur_String3=What do you think? Those armors and weapons used by Crusaders in the castle.<br>They themselves are vessels for the crystals. A chest made out of their equipment would be able to hold the crystals safely.
Occur_String4=You get me the materials, and I do the crafting. Enter the castle and bring me what I want.<br>Go on. No time to dawdle.
Doing_String=It's a LOT of materials... Then again, I'm not making an ordinary chest.
Completable_String1=Good. It's going to be fun! Now, it's my time to work up some Mukler magic.<br>If I discover a new Rift, you'll be the first to know.
Completable_String2=No thanks. Your discovery usually ends up with me doing more chores for you.
Completable_String3=I can't really deny that. Thanks, anyway. Now I can finally make real progress.
Complete_String=The look on Mukler's face was like that of a child who finally got the toy he wanted for so long. The difference is that the latter is of pure joy, but the former is more of a conniving nature. I hope he doesn't do anything weird... He's never caused any major trouble, but I can't help but feel anxious.
List_String=Mukler wants to make chests to hold the Crusaders' crystals for his research. He plans to use their equipment because they themselves are ideal vessels. All I have to do is get him the materials.

Occur_String2=You're saying you discovered that mine?
Occur_String3=Huh? I didn't tell you anything... and you already figured it out?<br>Ah... Yeah. I must be the one who found the mine! Because I look great at a glance...<br>You have better sense that I thought.
Occur_String4=Anyway, I found the Magic Gem Mine...<br>And I opened up the Rift to the Mine...<br>Shouldn't you be helping me in return, if you have any conscience at all?
Occur_String5=W-wait. How did you come to that conclusion?
Occur_String6=There are spiders and skeletons that get in the way of mining the Magic Gems.<br>They look like they were affected by the Magic Gems, and seem like they'll be hard to defeat...
Occur_String7=I need you to defeat those monsters... But doing just that would be boring, right?<br>Bring me the corpses of those spiders and skeletons. I have to find out something.<br>Hm. Saying corpses of skeletons sounds strange. Let's say Skeleton Fragments.
Occur_String8=Anyway, bring me that, and I'll allow you go inside the Magic Gem Mine.<br>Sounds like a good deal, right? I think I'm losing in this deal.<br>Anyway, you don't have to if you don't want to.
Doing_String=You won't become one of those skeletons, will you?
Completable_String1=What took you so long? Did you breed the monsters before killing them?<br>Good thing you made it out alive at least.

Occur_String4=You probably wouldn't understand, but... This is my latest design for a Rift controller.<br>Trenta MK-2 is the name!
Occur_String5=Rift controller? What will you do with that?
Occur_String6=You saw it in the Magic Gem Mine!<br>It's a machine that creates an artificial Rift!
Occur_String7=To create a Rift, you need to save up loads of Rift Warps and then... Boom! You make it explode.<br>The problem is that Rifts created like that are unstable. I'm trying to make them stable.

Name=Mysterious Artifact
Occur_String1=There are various types of artifacts, and each artifact has unique characteristic and feature.<br>That's why each artifact requires different materials.
Occur_String2=The way to make artifacts is relatively easy compared to the amount of power you get.<br>You just need to select an artifact that you want to craft and collect required materials.<br>Once you equip the artifact, the power from the artifact will make you stronger.
Occur_String3=That's it? That's too easy... This gives me more power, really?
Occur_String4=It's easy to make.<br>But artifacts can grow like people do.<br>If you want more power, you have to make the artifact grow.

Occur_String6=Oh, what I just gave you is a starter from the Rift Research Society. You can only make artifacts like the Growing Sprout.<br>It only has about one tenth of the power that a real artifact has.
Occur_String7=But it will be useful until you get used to artifacts and the labyrinth.<br>You will have to find the materials to create a real artifact later on.<br>I myself rarely have seen real artifacts, and only a handful artifacts had been improved.

Completable_String2=First, select the artifact you want to grow and clear Lupa's Labyrinth.<br>The artifact will absorb the energy from Lupa's Labyrinth and grow.<br>It's similar to equip it. Select the artifact you want to equip and its power will help you.
Complete_String=I crafted an artifact and also heard how to grow and equip it. But I'm still not fully convinced. Will this really make me stronger that easily?

Doing_String=If you want to take an Artifact that you created into the Labyrinth, please talk to the brother and sister, Hyre and Ross, next to me.
Completable_String1=Welcome, Knight. Nice to meet you.<br>I'm Hyre. And this one is Ross.<br>...<br>Ross? You should say hi.
Completable_String2=Hi. I'm Ross...
Completable_String3=Ross! Do it right! Be polite!<br>And this is his first time in the labyrinth, so explain it well!
Completable_String4=Ah...! Alright!<br>Hello... Nice to... meet you. My name is... Ross.
Complete_String=I got to meet Hyre and Ross. Hyre seems to be nice and cheerful... and Ross reminds me of Mukler. At least he seems to listen to Hyre.
List_String=I must meet Hyre and Ross and talk to them.
Mission_String=Talk to Hyre
Mission_Target1=Talk to Hyre

Name=Not Worth the Breath
Occur_String1=Sir, if it's the first time you are going... you must equip your artifact...
Occur_String2=Just speak casually. I can't stand it.
Occur_String3=Really? That sounds good to me.<br>Glad that we speak the same language.<br>Hyre is too formal.
Occur_String4=Then... first! Go take a look around the labyrinth and come back.<br>If you just die as soon as you go in or get scared and don't want to go in after I tell you everything, I'll end up wasting my breath right?<br>I'll explain when you come back.
Occur_String5=If you want more information, prove that you are someone who can get through the labyrinth first.
Doing_String=Tsk... That Mukler. He forbid anyone from going further because it's dangerous.<br>There's no one who knows more about the labyrinth than me...
Completable_String1=Ooh, you came back alive. Then, you deserve an explanation.<br>As you may have figured it out already, that place is connected to numerous other locations.<br>You can never know where you are, or what you might find.<br>No matter how far you go, you can never reach the end. Literally it's a labyrinth.
Completable_String2=Of course research is what matters to us, but you must be wondering what you'll gain?<br>You can obtain artifacts and grow them inside the labyrinth.<br>I know you heard about artifacts from Grande, so I'll skip that..<br>You get a special energy when you defeat Rift Predators. And that energy is what grows artifacts.
Completable_String3=Lastly, we have created a special device in this special place.<br>It's called the Spring and it lets you adjust the level of the labyrinth.<br>The more you wind up the spring, the more the rift is warped.<br>It gets more dangerous, but your reward will be greater as well. So always check the Spring. I can't and won't be responsible for what happens.
Complete_String=I went to the labyrinth like Ross said... it was a mysterious and incomprehensible place.
List_String=I must go to the labyrinth like Ross said. The only issue is that Ross talks like Mukler and I don't really like it.

Name=Labyrinth's Special Threat 1
Occur_String1=Since you've been in the labyrinth... didn't you see a monster with a special power there?<br>A monster that increases the attack power of other monsters, or something like that.
Occur_String2=Now that you say it, I might have seen it. Troublesome.
Occur_String3=We call that kind of power Aura.<br>So they are Aura monsters. Leave their lame name...
Occur_String4=Anyway, I'm researching those Aura monsters' power.<br>You know what I mean, right?
Occur_String5=So what kind of Aura do I need to bring?
Occur_String6=Hm. Good that you are straightforward.<br>I need the Swamp Ghost, Sacrifice, and Mana Burn types. Those three types.<br>There are a few more, but those three are the most urgent.<br>Please defeat the monsters with that type of Aura and collect the Aura energy.
Doing_String=What? Forget them already? I'll say it once again. Listen carefully.<br>I need the Swamp Ghost, Sacrifice, and Mana Burn types. Those three types.
Completable_String1=Alright. This should be enough.<br>I need to sort these out, so come back later.<br>I have another favor. But if you die before that, I guess it can't be helped.
Complete_String=I brought the Swamp Ghost, Sacrifice, and Mana Burn Aura types from the labyrinth for Ross. But, listening to him talk... I would have punched him if it wasn't for Hyre.

Name=High-density Labyrinth
Occur_String1=Knight, Knight! Can you please do me a favor too?
Occur_String2=If the reward is acceptable, and if it's something that I can do.
Occur_String3=We'll have a good reward prepared, and you should be able to do it easily.
Occur_String4=You heard about the Spring, right? In short, it's a device that lets us create a more heavily warped rift.<br>The more it's warped, the higher the level of the labyrinth, and the more dangerous it is. It also means that we can gather data faster from the labyrinth.<br>And you can aim for better rewards.
Occur_String5=So my request is that you explore the labyrinth at Level 5 or above.<br>Explore the labyrinth in a tougher environment, and let me know how you like it and what kind of place it is.
Occur_String6=That's simple. I don't even need to bring anything back.<br>I'll be back.
Doing_String=I'm not suspecting your skills, but the labyrinth isn't that easy.<br>Please be careful.
Completable_String1=You are back. Are you hurt anywhere?<br>How was the labyrinth at that level? Do you feel nauseous, or have a headache or ringing ears... or anything?
Complete_String=I carried out Hyre's request. I heard that staying in the rift for too long can cause mutations, but I feel fine even after several visits to that powerful labyrinth. I can't help but wonder about who I am.
List_String=I must clear Lupa's Labyrinth (level 5) and tell Hyre about the labyrinth and my condition.

Occur_String1=Oh, you're still alive. Good.
Occur_String2=Are you worried or being sarcastic?
Occur_String3=Of course... it's closer to the former. So calm down.
Occur_String4=I need more types of Auras. All the Auras have different characteristics and texture.<br>Well, that's why they have different effects.
Occur_String5=This time I need four types, Skin, Black Hole, Fiery Crash, and Recovery.<br>How you obtain them is same as last time. You know right?
Doing_String=This is an official request from the Rift Research Society. We won't rip you off with the rewards or anything, so don't worry!
Completable_String1=You got them all this time as well. Here's your reward. You may go now.<br>I have to research these, so we won't be seeing each other for a while.<br>Don't get killed.
Complete_String=I brought the Skin, Black Hole, Fiery Crash, and Recovery Aura types from the labyrinth for Ross. Regardless of the request, I would have beat him up if my brother was a brat like him.

Name=Help Collect Artifact Fragments
Occur_String1=It's been a while, Knight.<br>Have you gotten used to the labyrinth?
Occur_String2=It's a mysterious place, but it isn't too hard.<br>Oh, and I'm using the artifact I made with the fragment you gave me before.
Occur_String3=Is that so? I was about to ask you for a favor regarding the artifact fragments.
Occur_String4=You've been a great help, but we always need more adventurers who can help our research.<br>We can use artifact fragments to recruit more adventurers.<br>Just like we gave you one.
Occur_String5=...I knew you would understand. Thank you.<br>You'll get a god reward, so don't worry.
Occur_String6=Well, no... Sigh... Okay. I'll bring some.<br>But I also need artifact fragments, you know?
Occur_String7=Then, could you clean up the labyrinth so that I can collect fragments too?<br>If you can do that, I'll get the fragments myself.
Occur_String8=It would be great if it was a higher level. Maybe... level 10?<br>If you can clean up that level, I should be able to collect fragments.
Doing_String=How can I collect them?<br>Hehe. That's my business secret.
Completable_String1=Thank you, Knight. I was able to collect a lot of fragments.<br>I'll use them well.
Completable_String2=Hm... I can't tell you how I collect the fragments.<br>You are so persistent, Knight.
Complete_String=I cleared the labyrinth so that Grande could collect fragments. But no matter how hard I think about it, I still don't understand how Grande was able to collect fragments.
List_String=Grande said that if I clear Lupa's Labyrinth (level 10), she will collect the artifact fragments on her own. I got one from her before, so I need to help her.

Occur_String1=Knight, are your artifacts growing well?<br>You know how to grow them, right?<br>You can get energy to grow your artifacts when you defeat Rift Predators.
Occur_String2=If you have an artifact of level 10 or above, can you show it to me?<br>I've researched the rift for a long time, but high level artifacts are hard to come by.<br>Please.
Doing_String=One can never forget the brilliance of a powerful artifact.
Completable_String1=Wow! This gorgeous look and sparkle.<br>Ahh... I would love to have one of these some day.
Complete_String=I showed Grande a well-grown artifact and she stared at it blankly. It looks like she really wants one... but unfortunately she doesn't seem to have the power to grow an artifact.

[Quest_9508]
Name=Cry of the Rift Predator
Occur_String1=Have you met a Rift Predator inside the labyrinth?<br>Well, your artifact has leveled up and you are still alive. That means you've defeated the Rift Predators.
Occur_String2=We are still trying to find out who they are,<br>and the reason behind their outcry, but we still know almost nothing about them.
Occur_String3=Some Rift Predators look like people... I mean...<br>Some of them are like us.
Occur_String4=Yes. That's why I'm more concerned about them, but there's no way to reverse their mutation.<br>The only thing we can do is to continue our research in order to prevent other people who enter the rift from mutating as well.
Occur_String5=That's why we are very lucky to have talented people like you, Knight.<br>Since now we can explore the labyrinth at higher levels that have been too dangerous for us.
Occur_String6=Do you think you can handle the labyrinth at Level 15 or above?<br>Then please subjugate Rift Predators in there and collect their essence.
Doing_String=Do you think the Rift Predators are knights and warriors from another rifts?<br>Maybe, they all went in for their own reasons and got stuck there for ages.<br>And that's how their bodies were mutated and their minds gave in, making them cry out like that...
Completable_String1=Thank you. I'll take care of the Essences you brought.<br>I will produce meaningful outcomes. No matter what.

Name=Measuring the Max
Occur_String1=Where do you think is the end of the labyrinth?
Occur_String2=Well... inside the labyrinth, it's hard to tell where I am.<br>The endpoint of something is also a space-based concept, isn't it?<br>Since I can't tell my location, there's no way of knowing anything else.
Occur_String3=Oh, Knight. You are philosophical.<br>As expected, you aren't just all muscles.
Occur_String4=The Rift Research Society controls the level of the labyrinth with the Spring.<br>Our standard is a warrior who can clear level 20 or higher.<br>We believe that if one can meet that standard, they have a potential to reach the end of the labyrinth.

Occur_String2=Ah... I want to see one!<br>Grande said that a level 20 artifact is so rare that even she had only seen it twice.
Occur_String3=So... if your artifact reached the max level, could you show it to me?
Doing_String=A level 20 artifact... I can't even imagine what it's like!
Completable_String1=Here, the artifact. Look at it all you want.
Completable_String2=Oh! Oh! This is it! How can it be so beautiful and elaborate!!!

Occur_String5=H-hey... got it. Got it. Stop... Stop shaking me.<br>I'm getting dizzy.
Occur_String6=Oh, my... Hmm. Sorry. I was...<br>That's not what I wanted to say, but since you showed me the artifact... Hmm.
Occur_String7=Take your max level artifact to the Alchemist Merchant in Ohrdor.<br>He will cast alchemy on the artifact.<br>I don't know how he does it, but he can craft very rare items through artifact alchemy.
Occur_String8=However, the Growing Sprout is just an imitation made by the Rift Research Society,<br>so you won't get an item as good as if you were to use a real artifact.<br>So don't have high expectations when you get artifact alchemy on the Growing Sprout.
Occur_String9=Also!!<br>You have to keep this in mind.<br>The artifact used as a material for artifact alchemy will disappear!<br>So make sure you try artifact alchemy when you have an extra artifact.
Doing_String=Artifact alchemy is good... but it's unfortunate that such a beautiful artifact will disappear.
Completable_String1=Grande from the Rift Research Society told me to find you for artifact alchemy.<br>But... haven't we met before? You look familiar.
Completable_String2=Oh, another customer. Unfortunately, we have never met before.<br>And is that important? Artifact alchemy is what matters.<br>I'll explain, so listen well. And don't get mad at me when your artifact is gone.
Completable_String3=Melting a max level artifact to create something new. That's artifact alchemy.<br>The artifact disappears since I need to melt it first... I don't know what's going to come out at the end.<br>Since no one knows what the energy from the artifact will do with alchemy.<br>I have heard of those who got something very precious from artifact alchemy, and boasted about it.
Completable_String4=If you want to try it, give me your artifact. I'll cast the alchemy for you.<br>But I would suggest you use an artifact that you don't need.<br>Since you'll be in a pinch once the artifact disappears.<br>I won't stop you from using any artifact, but think carefully.

Combine them with existing Artifact Essences, and together they create Awakened Artifacts.<br>In fact, Lupa's Awakened Labyrinth is the result of Artifact study. In other words, it's all about the Artifacts.

Completable_String3=Anyway, %s_9_1, if you want to grow stronger, using Awakened Artifacts can help.<br>Oh, and if you create an Awakened Artifact, please show it to me. I'd love to see it. I really mean it.

Completable_String5=It must be a rift that someone created while studying the rift across the universe.<br>And the Porystal must be a key to the library.<br>You know, in the Room of Duty? I heard someone had made a rift into their vault. Books are nothing.
Complete_String=The Alchemist Merchant seems to know about the jewel he calls the Porystal and the library... but he doesn't look like he wants to tell me about it.
List_String=I was told that the Alchemist Merchant is well-acquainted, so I will go ask him about the jewel and the library.

Occur_String1=So, how was it over there? Was it quiet? Clean? Was there anyone?
Occur_String2=It was full of monsters.
Occur_String3=Full of monsters? So there was no one? That's a relief! Good!
Occur_String4=If you go there next time, please clean out the bookshelves.<br>I don't mean putting the books back on the shelves.<br>Destroy them so that no one can read them.
Occur_String5=Are those dangerous books?
Occur_String6=Well, it's not that... Don't ask, and please just do it.<br>I'll reward you well. So?
Doing_String=When I said it's a relief... you know,<br>I meant... it could be a bad guy's library. Right? That's why I said it's a relief.<br>If there are only monsters, it means no one has been there so far.
Completable_String1=Did you destroy the bookshelves? All in disorder?<br>Phew. I'm glad to hear that.
Complete_String=I destroyed all the bookshelves in the library for the Alchemist Merchant. The one who's telling me not to be concerned looks more concerned. I feel a little uneasy.

Occur_String3=Since you first saw them?<br>How many times have you been there?<br>How do you know that place so well?
Occur_String4=Huh? Did I say I saw them?<br>Oh right, I just saw them once. Gee, they look so scary.<br>I'm asking you because I don't want them to hurt others.<br>Not everyone in this world is as strong as you are, you know.

Completable_String1=Oh, good job. You are amazing.<br>Thanks for the help. Well...

Completable_String3=... No. I trust you, and I know you are smart.<br>I'm not telling you because I know you.<br>This is not something you have to burden yourself with.
Completable_String4=I'll tell you when the right time comes.<br>So please wait.
Complete_String=I want to ask the Alchemist Merchant about the truth behind the library... but I can't do anything but wait if he says so.

Completable_String3=Books? Again? Mm...<br>Ah, dang it! Did a Rift form in there too? This is not good.

Occur_String3=Ah, geez. You should've looked around.<br>I can't tell you anything if I don't know what kind of place it is.
Occur_String4=If you ever go back there, take your time and look around, will you?
Occur_String5=Is that place important?
Occur_String6=Well... No, not exactly. I just want to check something.<br>Thanks.
Doing_String=It can't be what I think it is... Mm? Oh, I was thinking about something else. Hah hah hah.
Completable_String1=Did you go there? You're really lucky, going somewhere others can hardly find twice.<br>So, tell me.
Completable_String2=It's an ancient archive, and light shines through its shelves and walls.<br>There aren't just a few cracks. The whole place looks like broken glass.
Completable_String3=And... This might sound strange, but it's as if the place is floating on water.<br>It doesn't sway or rumble, but I felt like I was on something that was floating.
Complete_String=I told the Alchemy Merchant about the old archive. Is that how a library is like when it's built on water? I've been to many places, but none of them was quite like this one.
List_String=I have to thoroughly investigate the other archive connected to the Porystal. Since the Rift can form anywhere, I'm not surprised it led me to an old archive this time, but I want to know why the Alchemy Merchant is acting so suspiciously.

Occur_String3=I think they did. Why?
Occur_String4=Please destroy all the shelves that release strange monsters.<br>Those shelves are not good. Neither are the books on them.
Occur_String5=You ask me to do things for you, but you won't answer my questions.<br>Why should I do anything for you?
Occur_String6=Th-this is... a job! Why don't you think of it as a secret job?<br>A special mission, that sort of thing.
Doing_String=All that was futile... Tsk, tsk.
Completable_String1=I destroyed all the shelves as you asked. I also scattered all the books. No one will be able to check them now.
Completable_String2=Thank you so much. And there's one more thing I'd like to askâ€”<br>No, I mean I've got a job for you!
Complete_String=I destroyed shelves and scattered books as the Alchemy Merchant asked. I checked the books, but they were written in unknown languages. Everything about this old archive is suspicious. So is the Alchemy Merchant.

Occur_String3=You don't need to know this. You're neck deep in this, which is all the more reason I can't tell you about it.<br>The problem is I don't know anyone else strong enough to help me.
Occur_String4=Darn it. That means I have to this, no matter what, right? This is going to cost you a lot.
Doing_String=There's a limit to everything... Why did I try to push past it?
Completable_String1=Thank you. That's a load off my chest, but it was only one of many regrets that I left behind.<br>I hope one day I can break this vicious cycle...

Occur_String2=And then, you have to get rid of its remains completely.
Occur_String3=Destroyers like you may not know, but genius creators like me can infer many things from tiny clues. So its remains must be completely wiped out. Do you understand?
Occur_String4=Sigh... I'm a little worried about asking you for two things at once.
Occur_String5=But since you've done everything well so far, you should be able to handle it, right? And it's not that hard.

Occur_String7=Hm... You don't look too confident...
Occur_String8=Hey... I'm just annoyed. How stupid do you think others are?
Occur_String9=Hm... I don't underestimate you. I just can't tell your strength. How could someone high above look down on earth and tell the difference in height among the creatures on the land? I just can't tell how capable others are. <br>I'm counting on you.

Occur_String3=Yes. I've got good eyes. I found a talent like you. You quickly finish up all kinds of tasks that many others have failed so far. But, this last one won't be so easy. I ran away as soon as I saw him because I sensed he was dangerous.
Occur_String4=I'm a genius who uses his head, not his body, you see. My brain will make great contributions to the entire Mu Continent, so it cannot get hurt. And, I have nothing to tell you about how dangerous this guy is. I ran away as soon as I felt a threat.
Occur_String5=How did you know he was dangerous?
Occur_String6=He's not like the watchmen in other rifts. I felt a very ominous energy. It was oddly familiar, but very unpleasant. And he looked totally different from the watchmen so far. He just looked dangerous.
Occur_String7=Nothing's for certain.
Occur_String8=...How foolish. It isn't just a speculation. It's a prediction based on diverse experiences. In other words, it's a correct answer. It seems you lack of comprehension to continue this meaningless dispute. Why don't you just go get him?

Occur_String4=Yes, right. You did the existing requests. This is like an insurance. Stupid people think there will be no problems, and somewhat smart people prepare a solution when the problem arises, and people like me, prevent problems from occurring. Do you understand?

That's why monsters are coming out from that rift.
Completable_String3=We are not sure, but there could be a time and space where Pandemonium has taken over.<br>The Myth in the Sky Temple seems to be happening because the remains of Orman are pulling in the time and space where Sky Temple has been invaded by Pandemonium.

Occur_String2=Dumpain is? Why?
Occur_String3=You really are ballsy. You're the first one I've met in Ohrdor who doesn't call Sir Dumpain sir.<br>To answer your question, I don't know. He just told me to find you.
Occur_String4=What if I don't go?
Occur_String5=Come on, I've got a reputation to uphold. I'm the head of the Commercial District, you know.<br>Plus Sir Dumpain is a generous man.<br>You should go. It'll benefit you too.

Completable_String1=Ah, %s_9_1. Welcome.<br>I'd like to ask you a favor.
Complete_String=I met Dumpain. I really didn't want to get involved with him, but he was the most powerful man in Ohrdor. I did it, just so he'd leave me alone.

Name=Pit of the Dead
Occur_String1=A favor? Who knew such word would exist in your vocabulary? I'm glad I'm still alive.
Occur_String2=I never imagined I'd be ridiculed by someone in Ohrdor one day. Funny, that.<br>Okay, enough joking around. Let's cut to the chase.
Occur_String3=To tell you the truth, I'm not that happy with the Room of Duty.<br>It's a dangerous place, filled with all kinds of monsters, and it's connected to my city.
Occur_String4=That alone is enough to set my teeth on edge, and now it's also connected to Pandemonium.
Occur_String5=Pandemonium?
Occur_String6=That's right. A place called the Pit of the Dead. And it's being managed by the Silver Sparrowhawks, which complicates things.
Occur_String7=I know you're acquainted with the Silver Sparrowhawks and Kundun. That's why I'm asking you this.<br>Go see what kind of place this Pit of the Dead is. It's simple, isn't it?
Occur_String8=I don't like that it's you who's asking, but I do like the idea of exploring Pandemonium.
Occur_String9=Good. Then enter the Room of Duty and go to Silver Sparrowhawk Delude.<br>I want to know everything that you find out about this Pit of the Dead. I'll be sure to reward you generously.
Doing_String=If that place is dangerous, I can use it as leverage over Kundun.<br>If it's not, that's good for my city.<br>Hm, not bad.
Completable_String1=Oh, %s_9_1. How did you know about this place?
Completable_String2=I've heard you connected Pandemonium to Ohrdor. What were you thinking?
Completable_String3=It's the work of Kundun and the Rift Research Society. This place is in Pandemonium all right, but it's strange.
Complete_String=I went to Delude, the keeper of the Pit of the Dead, in the Room of Duty. Who thought it'd be a great idea to connect Pandemonium to Ohrdor, the most crowded city in the earthly realm?

[Quest_9902]
Name=Strange Pandemonium
Occur_String1=This place is divided into multiple sections, and here and there, the word, The Pit of the Dead, is written in the demon language.<br>It's teeming with corpses and spirits reanimated by necromancy. Doesn't that sound strange to you?
Occur_String2=It does.<br>That legion commander of the demons, Sezak was his name I think, said necromancy was beneath them.<br>I don't think the demons care much about the Dark Mission's black magic.
Occur_String3=You're right. The demons look down their noses at the Dark Mission.<br>There's no way they would approve of its black magic.
Occur_String4=And this supposed Pandemonium is filled with its handiwork.
Occur_String5=Because it's the opposite of what we know about Pandemonium, Kundun is managing it directly through me.<br>Our investigation of it, however, is slow due to the dangers inside. I'm thinking, could you help us? I'm requesting it in an official capacity.
Occur_String6=Sure, as long as the price is right. And this place looks interesting, too.<br>By the way, did someone tell you I was coming? It's almost as if you were waiting for me.
Occur_String7=Kundun did.<br>He said you'd hear about this sooner or later, and that if you come, I should ask for help.<br>He said you wouldn't say no.
Occur_String8=Darn it, he got me. That old fox.<br>So, what do you need?
Occur_String9=First, please exterminate monsters in the Pit of the Dead Area 1.<br>We have to secure an opening into that place.
Doing_String=Be careful. Monsters in the Pit of the Dead possess both the Evil Energy and black magic.<br>I don't know what they can do with them, or what you might experience in there.
Completable_String1=You're as good as I heard. Good job. Now I can speed up my investigation process.
Complete_String=I cleared the Pit of the Dead (Normal 1) Area 1 and secured an opening. What's the purpose of this place?

[Quest_9903]
Name=Looking for Clues
Occur_String1=For now, we believe this is some kind of artificial facility<br>because of its name, Pit of the Dead, and the existence of black magic in the Pandemonium world.
Occur_String2=But we haven't figured out its purpose.<br>It'll be helpful if we can find the architect's journal or documents...
Occur_String3=We didn't find those things in Area 1, but maybe we can in other places. Don't you think?
Occur_String4=Could you go farther down? Please bring me anything you can find.
Doing_String=Please look for clues as you go down. Keep your eyes peeled.
Completable_String1=I've found this. There are numbers and some letters written on top, followed by a few paragraphs at the bottom. It looks like some kind of journal,<br>but I can't read the demon language.
Completable_String2=You're right. These numbers and letters mean a date in the demon language.<br>Mm... Dimitri? That must be the name of the author of this journal, and I think he's a demon.<br>Let me read it. It'll take a while because I have to translate.

[Quest_9904]
Name=Looking for New Clues
Occur_String1=This demon named Dimitri was relegated, and he shook hands with the Dark Mission<br>to create an army of the dead and punish those who wronged him.
Occur_String2=This explains the presence of black magic. This demon, Dimitri, must have been so desperate.<br>This Pit of the Dead was created in the farthest backwater of Pandemonium under absolute secrecy. If everything in this journal is correct, no other demons know about its existence.
Occur_String3=And since there's no living demon inside it, his rebellion failed. Did he wrote in his journal?<br>Why he failed?
Occur_String4=No, he didn't. Either he was too embarrassed about his failure,<br>or he couldn't write about it.
Occur_String5=Maybe we can find more clues aside from Dimitri's journal.<br>Please check the place more carefully. We were lucky with his journal. Its pages could've been scattered all over the place.
Doing_String=%s_9_1, thanks to you, finally I can put the puzzle together. I'm so excited!
Completable_String1=Oh, this is a bunch of papers. A human language. It's written by the Dark Mission.
Completable_String2=I think it's written by a member of the Dark Mission.<br>Its pages were scattered all over the place, and I don't know if I've put them in the right order.<br>It contains many words I don't know. Probably black magic jargon.
Completable_String3=Then, it must contain many references to the Pit of the Dead and the Dark Mission. Let me check.
Complete_String=I gathered scattered pages of a document and gave them to Delude. It was written in a human language, probably by the Dark Mission, but I couldn't understand the jargon in it. I'm sure Delude will tell me.

Name=Subjugate the Pit of the Dead
Occur_String1=I read the pages you brought the last time. Gee,<br>the first half of them is all about black magic research, and the later half is mostly expletives directed at Dimitri.
Occur_String2=It seems Dimitri made an unreasonable demand to the Dark Mission.<br>He wanted to feed more black magic to this place than it could handle.<br>In the end, the dead raged out of control, and devoured everything including Dimitri himself.
Occur_String3=The author of this journal saw his death.<br>He wrote he could die happily, having seen Dimitri die first.
Occur_String4=It's a fitting end for a greedy demon.<br>But that place is still swarming with monsters. Are you just going to leave them like that? Behind the locked gates?
Occur_String5=No. The demons will discover this place sooner or later.<br>If they come through the gates, with the dead close behind them, there will be a bloodbath.
Occur_String6=We must cull the dead in the Pit as best as we can.<br>You'll have to make at least two trips. Would that be all right?
Occur_String7=So we're cleaning up after the demons again.
Doing_String=Yup, because they're so sloppy.
Completable_String1=Good job. But that place is still fraught with the undead.<br>Will this war with the demons ever end?

Occur_String3=Please bring me some Undead Fragments from the Pit of the Dead for my research.<br>You can find them from the undead there.
Occur_String4=Undead Fragments?

Occur_String5=Hm. Could they be those men from the village? Got it. <br>Something is definitely going on.

Occur_String2=Then, that will be your last task. Please go and save the farmers. You just took out their scouts, so their encampment must be in disarray. Use this opportunity to rescue the farmers. It would be even better if you could take out of some of their captains as well.
Occur_String3=I'd wager you get a lot of complaints about overworking your men.

Occur_String3=People in Tempano City told me Grand Duke Aeon gave a national treasure to his second daughter Iope. The administrator I talked to didn't think the Grand Duke got his hands on the Lightbringer in the first place. Which story is true?
Occur_String4=Both of them are. The Grand Duke found only the sheath of the Lightbringer. That is what he gave to his daughter before his death. He was not able to find the sword itself.

Occur_String2=Oh, did Joseph send you here? Then... you have my trust. Commander Joseph, he... He has kept me out of harm's way since I was a child. I am in his debt...
Occur_String3=I am not here to listen to your life story, princess. <br>Joseph told me that you only have the sheath of the Lightbringer. And I am here to help you find the sword. Did your father tell you anything about its whereabouts?
Occur_String4=Unfortunately... Even the sheath is no longer with me. I was not the most popular princess in the dukedom. Because I... My mother was one of the maids serving Grand Duke Aeon. Father gave the sheath to me as a protection for my Mother and I after his death. That was his plan.
Occur_String5=So... Where is the sheath now?
Occur_String6=My mother had it at her residence in Canal City. But the city was attacked by the undead. I don't even know Mother is still alive...

Occur_String3=Lightbringer? Do you mean the legendary sword that glows on its own? I heard rumors about Princess Iope having the sheath. The rumor was true! <br>Ha... Practically all reputable archaeologists in Tephakin have searched for the sword at one time or other.
Occur_String4=I see... It's a treasure from the lost Karol Kingdom. I can understand why Tephakin is so desperate to find it. <br>But, without success. Iope will be disappointed.
Occur_String5=Wait, Wait! I think we can help each other here. I was looking for a mercenary or a contract knight to help us gather clues.
Occur_String6=What clue?
Occur_String7=You have no clue, do you? You're standing on one of the old ruins of the great Karol Kingdom itself! And, as you may know, those Dark Mission fanatics have turned the corpses of the people of Karol into the undead. It's just perfect timing for me, as an archaeologist, to study more about the people of the Karol Kingdom, since they are practically digging themselves up!
Occur_String8=Hm... it sounds like it makes sense.
Occur_String9=It DOES make sense! Also, the pylon over there was home to none other than the Night Watch, the famed scouts of Karol! I am sure there must be former Night Watches among the undead around here. If you bash the skeletons and rummage through what they are carrying, you will certainly find something that leads to the sword!

Occur_String3=Hm... The final... The final gate has been breached... Queen Lenavis... the Lightbringer held in her hands... facing the enemy...
Occur_String4=It seems Queen Lenavis held on to that sword until her last moment. Maybe the person who buried the queen put the sword in her tomb? It may explain why no one in the whole country was able to find the Lightbringer.

Occur_String4=Ah, that's quite sharp of you. You assume correctly. Commander Kali must have thought it better that I brief you. There's always someone keen on eavesdropping on what the commander has to say.
Occur_String5=To give you the details, Commander Kali is concerned about the simultaneous attacks on three of our watch posts. Since these posts were heavily guarded, the commander thinks the attacks wouldn't have been possible without help from inside.

Occur_String3=Based on these instructions, Orman knew his troops very well and tried to minimize their losses.<br>He was definitely different from the other high-ranking commanders of the Pandemonium Army I studied.
Occur_String4=Now, to the stone plate that the Gnoll Legion soldiers had...
Occur_String5=(Icarus translates the original copy of Orman's stone plate.)<br><br>Those who distinguished themselves during this Earth invasion operation will be rewarded with acreage on Earth.
Occur_String6=Orman was generous in rewarding his men for their efforts. That's highly unusual for a Pandemonium commander. They usually command their soldiers with terror.

Occur_String3=Nice to see you again, too. I just wanted to say thank you, on behalf of the entire Kanturian, for what you did for us last time.
Occur_String4=Ah, don't mention it. Do you get along better with your father now?
Occur_String5=Yes, thanks to you. He changed his mind after the incident. He made peace with other countries and decided to share Pectra energy with them.
Occur_String6=Glad to hear it. Well, it was nice talking to you.
Occur_String7=Wait! In fact, I need your help with something urgent.
Occur_String8=This better be important. Make it short, if that's even possible.
Occur_String9=We thought Datans were gone for good, but they are returning across the realm. In bigger numbers, too. Something's not right. I suspect Dracans may be behind this... But I can't make such an accusation myself, with the recent peace treaty and all. So...
Occur_String10=You want a third party to act as an intermediary. <br>Sounds simple enough. I will talk to Chaisong about it. See you later, kid.
Doing_String=Thank you, sir knight. We can't lose this hard-earned peace. My beloved's soul must be grateful to you, too.
Completable_String1=It is nice to see you again. We Dracans always welcome great heroes such as yourself. <br>Welcome, my friend!

Occur_String1=How have you been, Chaisong? Judging from the look on your face, not so well? <br>Is something troubling you?
Occur_String2=You're my friend. I don't lie to my friends. Datans, Woongpam's soldiers, have returned. I had thought they were gone for good... I was wrong.
Occur_String3=That's what I came here to talk to you about. <br>Estesia, the Chief Kalak's daughter, told me that Datans have been sighted across Kanturu as well. She says they seem to have grown in numbers. In fact, Kanturu suspect Drapia may be behind their return.
Occur_String4=Nonsense! I tell you because you are my friend, Woongpam used us Dracans for his experiments! And Datans follow Woongpam! <br>That is why we Dracans loathe Woongpam and his followers! And they say we are helping those Datans vermin? It's outrageous!
Occur_String5=Experiments? I always thought it strange that Datans look a lot different from Dracans... Now I know why. Did Woongpam use Pectra energy for the experiments?
Occur_String6=It's one of Drapia's top secrets, but you are our hero. You've earned the right. Yes. Woongpam tried to increase Dracans' power with Pectra energy. But His Majesty the king upholds the will of Bulcan, who pursues power in pure form. His Majesty never forgave his son for what he did.
Occur_String7=That was why Woongpam was banished from Drapia.
Occur_String8=So, we Dracans have no dealings with those vermin! <br>And... my friend! I need a favor from you.
Occur_String9=Let me hear it. I will do it if it's not too difficult.
Occur_String10=We received words that the Chakuas are planning to attack our camp on the Ice Lake Plains. But our army and most of the Dracans Knights have marched out to fight Datans. Without them, we can't stop the Chakua forces from advancing to Qwyinan Village.

Name=(T) Kainan and the Pectra Wand
Occur_String1=It seems we survived the worst of it. All thanks to you, stranger.
Occur_String2=Happy to help. By the way, did you see any Datans around these parts? I was asked by the Kanturu to talk to Chaisong. He told me that Datans have returned. The Kanturu are concerned that Drapia might be working with Datans.
Occur_String3=We Dracans only accept power that you earn through effort! Datans sacrificed our people to gain power. They are not Dracans anymore!
Occur_String4=Chaisong told me the same thing. That's a relief. <br>Oh, I also heard that Drapia and Kanturu decided to share Pectra energy. Who gets to keep the Pectra Wand in Drapia?
Occur_String5=The wand was to be Commander Chaisong's responsibility. But the Elder Council was adamant that they could not give the responsibility to the one who failed to protect Bulcan's Brazier. In the end, Vice-Captain Kainan was chosen to keep the Pectra Wand safe.
Occur_String6=(Kainan is in charge of the wand?) <br>Thank you for the information. Take care.
Occur_String7=Stranger, you are always welcome here! Next time we should get together in the village and drink until we pass out!
Doing_String=Kainan will be also glad to have you here. We Dracans love making friends with strong warriors.

Occur_String1=Have you gotten any better with your sword? Because you were not so impressive last time we met.
Occur_String2=Dracans Knights' ranks are decided purely based on merit. Challenge me anytime if you want to test my skills, stranger!
Occur_String3=Hey, hey, I was just joking. Relax already. <br>I just came here to ask you about something important. If you want to fight me, it'll have to wait.
Occur_String4=Hm, hm. I do apologize for my aggressive tone. Now then, what is it that you wanted to ask me?
Occur_String5=I talked to some Kanturus, and they told me Datans have returned. What makes it worse is that there are more of them than before. <br>As you know, spawning Datans consumes Pectra energy. Then the question is, with Woongpam gone, who supplies them with Pectra energy.
Occur_String6=Prince Woongpam had been obsessed with the energy until the very day of his banishment. He may have passed away, but the result of his research must have been remained. Any of the Datans could have succeeded the prince's legacy. It has been quite a while since his death, which must have given them enough time to find a way to produce the energy on their own.
Occur_String7=Hm... That makes sense. Is the Pectra Wand safe with you? <br>I just want to make sure it's safe.
Occur_String8=I have it right here. <br>If you have no more questions, I would like to ask you a favor myself.
Occur_String9=Sure. You gave me honest answers, and I should repay in kind.
Occur_String10=You must have heard that those Chakuas have a massive campaign planned. Their forces grew at an alarming pace. It was all thanks to a Rift that opened at the middle of their camp. <br>So, I would be grateful if you could close the Rift. What do you say?
Doing_String=And I won't go easy on you next time. Make sure you come prepared.
Completable_String1=You're back. What did the Dracans say?
Complete_String=(Dracans Knight Group Quest) (5/11)<br>Kainan, the Vice Captain of Dracans Knights, told me that the Pectra Wand was safe with him, and the growth of the Datans forces could be explained by someone continuing Woongpam's lifelong research on Pectra.

[Quest_200906]
Name=(T) What Datanses Are After
Occur_String1=Dracans are adamant that they have nothing to do with Datans. Datans were created by Woongpam, the banished prince, and those who gained power by unjust means are not Dracans anymore.
Occur_String2=Then... What about the wand that I delivered to them? Is it safe?
Occur_String3=The Pectra Wand is kept by Kainan, the Dracans Knight Vice-Captain. Kainan thinks one of the Datans may have succeeded Woongpam's research. And that would explain why there are so many of them now.
Occur_String4=But that does not... make any sense. It took us Kanturus hundreds of years to invent Pectra energy. Marongo was the one credited for the achievement, but he also worked on the foundation built by his predecessors over the years.
Occur_String5=Datans don't have that for sure... Dracans are not involved, and Datans do not have the advanced technology to create Pectra energy, then how... <br>There must be something we missed...
Occur_String6=Oh, right. Recently, Datans are more often sighted in the Southern Town through the Rift. Southern Town is... well... where Marongo lived. Then, it may mean Marongo left something in the town that we don't know about. Are you saying... those Datans are trying to find whatever it is?
Occur_String7=All we can do now is to hope that the town has what we're looking for. And I am going to destroy the Rift so that the Datans cannot reach the town.
Occur_String8=Please, knight. Don't let those evil beings take the Marongo's lifetime work.
Doing_String=Once again, the peace between Kanturus and Drapia hangs on your shoulders.
Completable_String1=I was beginning to think you'd never return. Did you find anything?

Occur_String3=Oh my goodness... They already deactivated the Guardian long ago, and have been stealing Pectra energy from the fusion reactor. I have to go to the Glacier Cave right now. They could have already turned Guardian Dio to their side.
Doing_String=If they did, we may be too late. I... have a bad feeling about this. <br>Take this. This is my identification mark. If Guardian Dio works properly, it will allow you to go to the fusion reactor.

Occur_String1=I know you are in a hurry, but calm down. First, Guardian Dio had been taken by the enemy. It attacked me on sight. So I destroyed the Guardian and went to the fusion reactor. Someone had already taken most of the energy.
Occur_String2=But they cannot take the energy without the Pectra wand. How could the Datans have taken it?
Occur_String3=They may have found the schematics for the wand in Marongo's house. Making the wand would have been much easier than building the fusion reactor.
Occur_String4=That's... possible. Marongo... His dream for peace is... destroyed once again...
Occur_String5=We have to find out what they plan to do with the energy. They have been stealing it for quite a long time. In the worst case scenario, they may be working with the Pandemonium to turn the Evil Energy into an invasion portal.

Occur_String1=The situation is worse than I thought. I found proof that Datans have taken the Pectra energy from Kanturu. One of them must have succeeded Woongpam's legacy. Datans have been using the stolen energy to turn their Dracans followers into Datans.
Occur_String2=Woongpam's successor... I do hope to see who that wretch is... So, what do Kanturus plan to do about it?
Occur_String3=Knowing Kalak, he would have tried to start a war with other countries if you or I gave him the news. I asked Estesia, his daughter, to tell him what happened and persuade him to join forces with Drapia.
Occur_String4=Then, we have to wait and see if she was successful. I appreciate your efforts, my friend. <br>And one more thing. I am afraid I have some bad news for you.
Occur_String5=What is it? I'm not even surprised, though. It's been nothing but bad news lately.

Name=(T) Leader of the Dark Shadows
Occur_String1=Vice Commander Amorel? That was the dark elf's name. Vice Commander? That's quite high up in the ranks.
Occur_String2=Yes, I never thought a high officer would collude with the enemy... I don't know what to make of it.
Occur_String3=Yes, you do. You have the evidence right in front of you. Who is leading the Dark Shadow? I'll visit the commander myself and put an end to this once and for all.
Occur_String4=The commander of the Dark Shadow is... Miren Amonak. I was trained by her. She was the first commander of the Shadow Phantom.
Occur_String5=Ah, you mean that arrogant aid to Queen Cara. I had my suspicions since she always seemed to know where to be. Now I have a chance to find my answer.
Occur_String6=And I found this from the vice commander's body. It looks like some kind of contract. I think you'd better keep it.
Doing_String=Just in case anyone asks, I didn't ask any favors from you.
Completable_String1=It's been a while. I heard that you've sided with Ashas. You have some nerve, showing your face around here.
Complete_String=(Iris Individual Quest) (5/7)<br>It was Amorel, a Dark Shadow Vice Captain, who had been collaborating with the Dantarexes. I have to talk to Miren Amonak, the leader of the Dark Shadow, and demand an explanation.

Name=(T) Miren Amonak
Occur_String1=Yes, I fought for them. To be honest, I've had too much fun playing with you Dark Shadows. And I found this while I was at it.
Occur_String2=Your insolence knows no bounds... Are you really that desperate to die?
Occur_String3=We can discuss that after you look at this.
Occur_String4=.. Where did you find this?
Occur_String5=I told you. I found it while I was beating some sense into your Dark Shadows.
Occur_String6=I see. I see what you're trying to do here. But we Dark Shadows serve Queen Cara. It's your word against ours.
Occur_String7=I expected as much. That's why I came prepared. You know Amorel, your vice commander? I found a copy of this contract signed by her. She's been colluding with the Dantarex. It was despicable. Ah, Iris has the contract. You won't get it even if you kill me here.
Occur_String8=These claims of treason that you're making are unthinkable. And you have every reason to make it up to blackmail us. You don't expect Her Majesty will believe anything you say, do you?
Occur_String9=I'll never know until I confront her with the evidence. I'm going to the queen and break the news to her. If she doesn't believe me, Lunedill will head to the council with the evidence I found. I so want to see your face when that happens.
Occur_String10=With hard evidence like this, the council is sure to launch a full-on investigation on you Dark Shadows. And you'll be one of the targets. I had my suspicions about you. You always seemed to know exactly where to be.
Doing_String=Stop this nonsense while you still can, stranger.
Completable_String1=I heard what happened at the temple. Are you hurt?
Complete_String=(Iris Individual Quest) (6/7)<br>I went to Miren with the evidence that her vice captain, Amorel, had been colluding with Dantarexes. Then, Miren accused me of trying to deceiving her. I have to see Queen Cara and, if she does not listen to me, go to the Congress with Lunedill.

Occur_String3=Really? After I did all those favors for you? Anyway, what are they going to do with the adjutant?
Occur_String4=Well... It will be a probation, nothing more. She has stellar service record, and... Her Majesty wants to leave it at that.
Occur_String5=Probation? For a traitor? What kind of country is this?
Occur_String6=There's nothing I can do. For what it's worth, Miren will be barred from official duties for a while, and the Dark Shadow will not try anything reckless while they're under the council's surveillance. I expect that it will loosen some of the red tape that has been tying me down.
Occur_String7=And you made this all possible. I appreciate it.

Completable_String1=P-please! Wait! I'm not a spider! Please don't kill me! I'm not a spider!<br>I'm Petunia, an elf from Noria! I was a princess! Princess of the little elves!

Completable_String4=I thought I was going to die, and then one of them put a curse on me. I think it was their leader.<br>It wanted me to live as a hideous spider forever.<br>When I came to my senses, I found myself here, turned into... this.

Completable_String1=Huh? You're here for me? Well, well, you've finally decided to become my loyal servant!<br>It took you a while, but my generosity is bigger than the whole MU Continent. I forgive you.
Completable_String2=That's not even funny. Listen, I need your help.
Completable_String3=Help? Heeelp? You call that â€śaskingâ€ť for help? Let's try that again.
Completable_String4=You'd better tell me when I ask nicely.

Occur_String2=If you want to enter a specific time-space through a Rift, you sometimes need a catalyst that shares the same property as your destination.<br>You're going to a spider lair, so you'll need spider catalyst. That's because the beings who occupy a specific time-space can be considered one of its properties.
Occur_String3=And you may want some unique samples for that.<br>Try going to the Pandemonic Cave and Pit of Nightmares.<br>I heard that you can find spiders in those places. Get me some samples from those spiders.
Occur_String4=You are unusually helpful. What's the catch?
Occur_String5=Well, it's what's called give and take. You've done me some good, and I'm paying it back. That's all I'm saying.<br>I guess I'm talented AND generous. That's what I'm all about! Man, I'm so awesome.

Occur_String1=Oh, that's interesting.<br>Casting a curse takes a lot of preparation. There's no way the spiders would be so thorough. If they really cast the curse, it can't be too serious.
Occur_String2=You mean, the curse will go away if I just wait?
Occur_String3=Yes, I believe so. Nevertheless, you don't want to leave her in her current state for too long. One's appearance influences one's inner self.<br>The longer she lives as a spider, the more she will become like one. It will have a lasting effect, even after she turns back into an elf.
Occur_String4=Bring me the bodily fluid, legs, innards, and skin of the spiders living in that spider lair. I'll see if I can make a potion with them. I need them in pretty large quantities, though. Can you handle that?

Occur_String1=The Sinking Darkness sect is based in the Rift on the northernmost part of Karolsandria.<br>Its members are sinister and calculating,, and they revel in setting up their enemies so they can watch them slowly fall into despair.<br>Many of them prefer attacking from a distance. They really don't like having any physical contact with their enemies. Be careful.
Occur_String2=The symbol of this sect is a warped pentagram. Subjugate their stronghold and bring me their symbols. That'll discourage the rest of the Dark Mission.<br>Make sure the darkness continues to sink.

Name=(T) Last Killing Fest
Occur_String1=Let's see... The Killing Fest sect is based in the Rift that is southwest of the Yak Breeding Camp on the Ice Lake Plains.<br>Its members are very dangerous. They're as cruel as their sect's name suggests. They're crazed for flesh and blood and screams. They lunge at anyone that they see. Be careful not to let them get close to you.
Occur_String2=Their symbol is a wave-patterned dagger named the Carnage Kris. Get rid of them and bring me their daggers as proof.<br>Let them enjoy their last killing fest... of themselves.

Occur_String1=The Crushed Hope sect is based in the Rift in the east of the Hermit's Abode in the War Shelter, Litenberg.<br>Its members use black magic in the most disgraceful way. They reanimate corpses, causing their souls to fall, by thoroughly desecrating the dead. They leave the stench of rotting corpses wherever they go.
Occur_String2=Even their symbol is a brand on contaminated flesh. Please punish them and bring their symbols.<br>Getting rid of them will be a staggering blow to the Dark Mission.<br>They've crushed the hopes of others. Let them taste their own medicine.
Doing_String=This faction chose the Contaminated Flesh Brand as their symbol... I hope you've got strong nerves.<br>Well, seeing these things will cause more than nausea, though.

Name=(T) Probation
Occur_String1=The Dark Mission is larger and more sinister than you think. Even their leader Zakarian does not know all about their dark deeds.<br>I wish I could help you eliminate the last one of them, but... I'm afraid that I've told you everything I know.
Occur_String2=It's more than that. Wiping out the three sects did a number on the Dark Mission, costing it at least half of its members.<br>Well %s_9_1, What do you think?
Occur_String3=I'm still dubious of his intention,<br>but what we've achieved with his cooperation is worth ignoring that little bit of doubt.
Occur_String4=Kinzen, thanks to you, we were able to significantly diminish their forces.<br>In recognition of your contribution, by the power given to me as the commander in chief of Mediah, I accept your request. Welcome.
Occur_String5=Thank you, Lord Kundun. Thank you for putting some of your trust in me. I am glad and grateful.<br>Thank you, %s_9_1. Without you, I would have no choice but to return to the Dark Mission and aid them in their evil deeds.
Completable_String1=But you can't deny your responsibility for some of the horrible crimes of the Dark Mission. Even the slightest transgression.
Completable_String2=Fair enough. I've proved to you my trustworthiness through my testimony and cooperation, but I know that doesn't give me a free pass.
Completable_String3=That's right. I'm accepting you into my kingdom, to give you an opportunity to repent.<br>You said black magic is about life and death and can save many people. Prove it.<br>That's my first order for you as your new leader.
Complete_String=(Dark Mission Group Quest) (10/10)<br>Kinzen was an executive member of the Dark Mission. His past deeds as a member of the cult will follow him around for the rest of his life.

Doing_String=Zakarian... I've some personal beef with him. He didn't seem to be a bad person.<br>Or maybe he was disguising himself from the beginning.
Completable_String1=Hm? Who are you? This place is under investigation. It's off limits to civilians.
Completable_String2=I am here at Kundun's request. I heard you found some clues about Zakarian?

Occur_String2=As a matter of fact, yes. He built a secret lab to revive demons with black magic.<br>The problem is that we don't know where it is. We're looking into other documents and logs, but there is no other clue as to its location.
Occur_String3=That elf, Zakarian, was once called a sage.<br>Okay, I'll ask around in Noria. I know a few elves I can talk to.

List_String=(Zakarian Individual Quest) (2/4)<br>I had a feeling Zakarian's secret facility was in Noria, so I went to meet Lunedill. She's the princess of Noria, so she must know what Zakarian did in her kingdom.

[Quest_201552]
Name=(T) Location of His Secret Facility
Occur_String1=He researched demon-reviving magic here in Noria? I can't believe it.<br>And to think I once looked up to him as a sage...
Occur_String2=I heard from a Shadow Phantom that Zakarian used to visit the Broll Encampment east of the Chaber Fortress. If the facility exists, it is likely to be near there.<br>But there's no space to build anything there...
Occur_String3=Is there a Rift around there?
Occur_String4=Yes, there is one. But why?
Occur_String5=His facility must be in the Rift. I fought some Dark Mission factions a while ago, and all of their hideouts were located inside Rifts.<br>Maybe Zakarian did the same.
Occur_String6=That might also be why the facility has not been found. I see. I will have the Shadow Phantoms ready.
Occur_String7=It doesn't matter. I know you're short-handed because of the war with the Ashas.<br>I'll ask you when I really need help. You can help me then.

Name=(T) Necro Cores
Occur_String1=Common black magic is not powerful enough to revive demons. So, Zakarian used special crystals called Necro Cores to revive them.
Occur_String2=So, we'll have to get rid of these cores?
Occur_String3=As a matter of fact, yes. According to Zakarian's journal, Necro Cores are quite difficult to create.<br>If we destroy them all, he will have no option but to give up on his plan.
Occur_String4=Wait, I remember Zakarian giving me a weird request. I don't remember the details, but it was something the elves detest... That must have been one of the ingredients for the Necro Cores.<br>And I went out of my way to get those for that sage...
Occur_String5=Don't dwell on it. Let's focus on stopping him right now.
Doing_String=Anyway, It's my first time seeing Princess Lunedill in person. She's so beautiful.<br>I've seen many elves, but they don't even compare to her.
Completable_String1=I think I destroyed all the Necro Cores. I couldn't find any more of them.<br>Even if I missed some, they shouldn't pose a serious threat. There might be enough to revive one or two demons.
Completable_String2=An impressive work. It was an honor to witness your deeds by my own eyes.<br>Shall I report to Lord Kundun? Or did you want to deliver the news yourself?
Completable_String3=Bragging isn't really my thing. You deliver the message.<br>And send for me if you learn anything else about Zakarian. I will make him pay for everything he's done.

Name=(T) Their Prosperity and Fall
Occur_String1=I fought plenty of Chakuas. But I didn't know they had a civilization. Is that really the truth, though? They didn't look civilized at all.
Occur_String2=The ancient Chakuas were a powerful race who controlled more than half of Litenberg Continent.<br>The Dracans have a saying they use when warning children who don't behave themselves: â€śThe Chakuas will come and get you.â€ť This means the Chakuas were a source of terror for Dracans. There are tons of other evidence that testifies to how prosperous they were.
Occur_String3=If that's the case, how'd they end up like they are now?
Occur_String4=The majority of scholars believe that it's because they sided with demons.<br>When Bulcan created Dracans, the Dracans and Chakuas began to fight over control over Litenberg. The Dracans defeated Chakuas battle after battle under Bulcan's protection. To turn the tide, the Chakuas turned to demons... and it was the beginning of the fall of their civilization.
Occur_String5=After siding with the demons, the Chakuas had gained the upper hand for some time. But they were soon corrupted and contaminated by the demons' energy.<br>They realized their error and severed their ties with the demons... but it was too late.
Completable_String1=It seems that demons are involved in every story with a bad ending.<br>But I don't recall seeing any Chakua ruins while I was in Litenberg. Where can I find some clues?
Completable_String2=According to the legends, ancient Chakuas were able to harness the power of Rifts, and they built several gigantic structures across several Rifts.<br>If we can locate the structures, they will tell us more about the ancient Chakua civilization.

Doing_String=So, anything goes. Just collect anything that looks a bit out of the ordinary to you. I've found some crucial records in the most unlikely spots.
Completable_String1=Okay, I brought everything I found from the Chakuas that looked decent.<br>Among them are some odd-looking kettles.<br>Are you sure these are what you're looking for?

Occur_String2=â€śStrange beings donning red armorâ€ť must mean Kanturians. The description matches their appearance. Then â€śironâ€ť means the Dios controlled by them.<br>â€śDry spiralsâ€ť are Rifts, and â€śflow to the moonâ€ť refers to the west. They are expressions commonly found in other ancient texts.<br>So...
Occur_String3=It's Kanturu Musai.<br>There's a Rift in the western part of the area. The structure must be in the Rift.<br>That's amazing. I didn't know Chakuas used to write like this. It sounds almost poetic.

Occur_String2=The Blood Ice Peak got its name after the Three-year War. It used to be a sacred mountain thought to be inhabited by gods.<br>So, the phrase â€śOn the road to the home of the godsâ€ť means the Sanguine Highlands. I need you to look into the Rift west of the area.

Occur_String2=â€śIce that neither freezes nor meltsâ€ť means crystals, and the Mining Gorge is the only place where they mine crystals.<br>â€śFlows to the sunâ€ť means the east. So, the text points to a Rift east of the Mining Gorge.

Doing_String=I wonder what you'll find at the next structure. I can't wait to see them!
Completable_String1=These... are weapons. I'm not sure yet, but ancient Chakuas seem to have been able to craft more sophisticated weapons than what scholars originally believed.<br>Weapons can show the level of technology at the time, so they are always important histOrikal materials.

Name=(T) An Amazing and Incredible Discovery
Occur_String1=Yes! He's so brilliant. How does he come up with these ideas? I have a lot to learn from him.<br>His interpretation really does answer all my questions.
Occur_String2=The emblem consists of Chakua letters written over each other in a certain way. And the letters read...<br>â€śAt the end of a white that has nowhere to go, dry spirals rush toward the sun. Chakuas' one and only belief.â€ť<br>It sounds like we're about to make an unprecedented discovery! We may even discover Chakuarium!
Occur_String3=Chakuarium is a temple that is frequently mentioned in ancient Chakua literature. But it was considered a myth because no one has ever seen the place for real.<br>But... maybe it was a real place, after all.
Occur_String4=I hope so. So, which Rift does the text point to?
Occur_String5=I think it points to the War Shelter. It says â€śrush toward the sun,â€ť so the Rift must be located in the east.
Doing_String=If Chakuarium is really in that Rift, you and I will leave an everlasting mark in the history of archaeology.
Completable_String1=It's incredible! There are so many! So, this place IS Chakuarium!<br>I've never seen anything like this! Or that! I've studied ancient Chakua for almost ten years now, but I've never seen many of the artifacts here!

Occur_String3=We can't change the past. But I feel the same way.
Completable_String1=If you hadn't been around, the secret of ancient Chakua would have been lost forever. And the time I spent in this freezing land would have been for nothing.<br>Thank you once again, %s_9_1.

Completable_String1=The three relics are the Bronze Sword, Bronze Mirror, and Bronze Bells. The sword gave Pabillune immeasurable power, and the mirror deflected any harm that came to him. Also, when Pabillune rang the Bronze Bells, Bulcan's messenger would appear and show him which way to go.

Occur_String3=Ashas Nakan hardliners have been demanding to restore the treasures for some time now. They insisted that we restore the great heritage from our ancestors, whether their power is real or not.<br>However, there is no way to restore them, and arbitrarily putting them back together would amount to a blasphemy. So, their demand was ignored.
Occur_String4=They tried to legitimize their act by restoring the treasures.<br>If the relics' power is real, they'd be able to use them. Even if it's not, they would have been able to attract many Ashas to join them by showing them the three treasures as evidence of Pabillune's and Bulcan's blessing.

This time, we were able to bypass most of that because we're facing a critical situation here.<br>The Kobolds are surprisingly smart, and they can make their own guns and catapults. If our technology falls into their hands, they are sure to use them for their own shady purposes.
Occur_String4=I've got to hand it to them, though. I didn't think they would actually go all the way to that frozen continent.
Completable_String1=Kobolds are demons who settled on Earth after the war with the Pandemonium. They are ranked at the bottom among the demons.<br>They are probably trying to prove themselves in the war to raise their status. That's why they stole our technology.

Occur_String1=By the way, I didn't even ask you what you're investigating. You look like you're an Ashas. Haven't you heard about me?
Occur_String2=Mm... Judging by your fighting finesse, I think I know who you are. And if what I've heard is correct, you don't hurt others without reason. Do you?
Occur_String3=I don't like flatterers, but it seems you're a smart flatterer. So, what are you doing here?
Occur_String4=Ha ha. You're more persistent than I thought. The investigator and I are researchers sent here to find out the cause of an incident that took place in this lab. Are you happy now?
Occur_String5=No, not at all. I've heard some test subjects raged out of control, and it was orchestrated by Baraex, the former head of this place. What kind of cause are you looking for?
Occur_String6=Mm... You know too much already. Only a handful of Ashases know what you know.
Occur_String7=I thought you Ashases share all your information with each other through telepathy or something. Well, whatever. It has nothing to do with me. I won't ask anymore.
Occur_String8=Whew, thank you! I was worried you might not stop. Ah, by the way, after you hunted the wolves, didn't you notice anything peculiar beyond the screen door?
Occur_String9=I saw the plants that you called Tentacles and various mutants. I cleaned up that place once, and they're already back.
Occur_String10=That's not good. The more of them there are, the more spores get in the air. In that sense, could you take care of them this time?
Doing_String=Over the years, I've learned that knowing too many secrets isn't good.
Completable_String1=Not long ago, there were so many spores in the air that they're visible, but not anymore.
Complete_String=(Restricted Area Creature Group Quest) (2/11)<br>I asked Foy why he was here, but he was reluctant to answer. He said what I already knew, that this lab was only known among a handful of people of his kind. I said I wouldn't ask him anymore because it had nothing to do with me.

Occur_String2=Mm... You're here, so you might not know this, but there are 8 separated spaces used as labs. Well, most of them are inaccessible because of that screen door.
Occur_String3=Eight lab-like spaces... Anything else? For one thing, there's more of the mutant Tentacles and wolves you've seen.
Occur_String4=Ah, there are mutant creatures here and there that might have been humans once. But they're so far gone that they're hardly recognizable.
Occur_String5=They could have been the researchers and administrative staff of this lab. This is the best news I've heard!
Occur_String6=Huh? How come this is the best news?
Occur_String7=Think about it: if they really are the employees of this lab, one of them could carry a research journal or a work log.
Occur_String8=Speaking of which, I'd like you to check them for research journals and work logs. Who knows? They might provide important clues for this case.

Occur_String1=I didn't notice this before, but there are broken machines here and there. They look like they're research equipment. Do you have any ideas what they are?
Occur_String2=Sorry, but I'm not quite experienced enough to tell you what they are. Why don't you ask the investigator when he comes? He knows this place better than anyone else. He should be able to tell you.
Occur_String3=Better than anyone else? That sounds peculiar. Did he work here before?
Occur_String4=Ah, ha ha ha ha! I phrased it wrong. I should've said he knows more than I do. My mistake!
Occur_String5=Hm. Well, alright. I'll ask him when he gets here.
Occur_String6=You've been to most places inside the lab. Could you tell me what you think is the most problematic?
Occur_String7=There are clusters of mutant spores in a few rooms. They keep releasing spores in the air. They'll cause a problem if left alone.
Occur_String8=Then, could you get rid of those spores and collect some of them for sampling purposes? We can study them and develop chemicals to purify the air.
Doing_String=If everything goes well in here, I'll suggest to my superiors that we build a lab in your name, sir knight.
Completable_String1=These samples look fresh! They should be enough for our studies, too.
Complete_String=(Restricted Area Creature Group Quest) (4/11)<br>While checking here and there in the Restricted Area for Foy, I started noticing broken machines that I hadn't before.

Occur_String1=Ah, I almost forgot something important. Since this once was a secret laboratory, it's crucial that we preserve the research books and everything else in here. How's the condition of the rooms in there?
Occur_String2=As far as I know, it's not good. Actually those rooms are swarming with mutant frogs. It's a mess in there.
Occur_String3=Oh, no. That's a big problem! Do you mind exterminating the frogs in the rooms? It's really important that we preserve this research facility as best as we can.
Doing_String=I should've cleared those rooms first. The investigator will be angry when he finds out.

Occur_String2=That... I think you're hearing mutant wasps. I saw a pretty big wasp in the garden on the other side of this wall.
Occur_String3=Oh no, has the queen wasp specimen that I saw in the research journal escaped? That's bad. Oh, I checked the research journal that you brought me last time. According to what it says, these wasps reproduce at an extremely fast rate.
Occur_String4=Then, we'd better get rid of her before there's too many of them.
Occur_String5=To make matters worse, she's mutated... *Shudder* Then, please take care of that queen wasp this time.

Occur_String2=Don't thank me. You're paying me to do this. By the way, while fighting the queen wasp, I saw some test subjects that looked like Sapis here and there. You Ashases are using the monsters that are already half-mutant. Do you not know how dangerous that is?
Occur_String3=That... I had no idea. Those test subjects also must have been confidential. I didn't see anything about them in the research journal you found for me.

Occur_String1=Now the only place left is the situation room, which is the most important. Before I came here, I was told that voice data-saving devices were set up along the hallway to the situation room.
Occur_String2=Unless the incident happened too quickly for anyone to take action, someone could've left information about the cause of the incident on one of those devices.
Occur_String3=Hm. So do you want me to collect the voice data this time?
Occur_String4=That's right. Let me give you this storage device. Just insert it into those devices and take it out. Thank you for your help again.

Occur_String1=Mm... I've checked the voice data, but I didn't find any clue as to the cause of the incident. *Sigh...* Then, again, if this was so easy, we wouldn't have needed the investigator.
Occur_String2=But that doesn't mean the data you collected are completely useless: they include useful information, such as the brief time of the incident and the speed of the spores that have spread across the lab.
Occur_String3=It'd be great if I can figure out whose voice this is... Ah, don't worry. I can take care of this on my own.
Occur_String4=Wait. I'm sorry I interrupted you, but I think there's a problem with the situation room that you think is important. I heard the sound of a giant monster howling sometimes, and it was familiar to me.
Occur_String5=I thought it came from the Thud-tle that I took care of before, but I didn't check. I wanted to bring the voice data to you first.
Occur_String6=Hm. If you're right, then that's bad. Ah, come to think of it, the research journal had information about a substance in these spores that zombifies their hosts.
Occur_String7=If that's true, Thud-tle might still be alive in zombie form.
Occur_String8=Even if it is, there's a way to take care of it. The medicine I gave you before contains an active ingredient that fights infection by the spores. If you can find the raw ingredient for that substance, I can use it and formulate a medicine that can keep that monster, Thud-tle, from resurrecting again.
Occur_String9=All right, then tell me where I can get that raw ingredient. I'll get it for you. But even if you make the medicine, how are we going to feed it to him?
Occur_String10=Bring the ingredient first, and I'll tell you what to do afterward. Actually the source of that ingredient is also confidential, but I'll tell you since we're in on this together.

Occur_String1=Here's the first batch of voice data. If what you drew here is the power generator, they're damaged in these places. And the recording devices must have some sort of order for their activation. Most of them didn't respond when I tried to activate them.
Occur_String2=Ooh! That's exactly what I've heard! Amazing! By the way, the power generators are broken, huh? You were able to activate only one device, which means the second power generator is not functioning.
Occur_String3=I'm not sure if you know this, but to repair these devices, we have to bring in replacement parts from the outside! And their parts are made of different materials from different locations!
Occur_String4=I'm sorry, but please check where exactly the second power generator is broken! Then I'll tell you where you can find the replacement part!
Doing_String=It's a win-win situation for both of us! Don't you think?
Completable_String1=Mm... I see. That part... Let me check my notebook.
Complete_String=(Baraex Individual Quest) (9/22)<br>I told the investigator that most of the power generators were broken. He said repairing them required materials from the outside, and he asked me to check exactly where the machines were broken.
List_String=(Baraex Individual Quest) (9/22)<br>Check where the second power generator is broken for the investigator.
Mission_String=Check where the second power generator is broken
Mission_Target1=Check the damage location

[Quest_201930]
Name=(T) Burotonium Mine
Occur_String1=Hm. I've located where you can find the materials for that part, but...
Occur_String2=But what?
Occur_String3=They're not located on this continent! They're in a different world on the other side of the Rift! Are you okay with going there?
Occur_String4=I'm used to that sort of thing. You got me worried for no reason. <br>Alright, tell me which Rift, and I'll be right back.
Occur_String5=I knew you'd say that! So I marked the Rift's location on this note. <br>Then, I'll be counting on you!
Doing_String=I like your unflappable attitude! All the other Contract Knights should learn from you!
Completable_String1=Ooh! Look at this beautiful burotonium! You're amazing! Absolutely amazing!
Complete_String=(Baraex Individual Quest) (10/22)<br>I told the investigator about the damaged parts in the machine. He said that I had to go to another dimension to find the materials for the replacement parts. He then gave me the location of the Rift connected to that dimension.
List_String=(Baraex Individual Quest) (10/22)<br>Move to the Burotonium Mine, defeat monsters, and collect the ores.
Mission_String=Move to the Breath of the World Tree - South and look for the Burotonium Mine

Name=(T) Repaired the second Power Generator
Occur_String1=Now, replace the broken part with this, and the machine will operate again.
Occur_String2=Alright. I'll come back if I find more broken machines.
Occur_String3=Ah, could you hold on a moment? Please use this to copy data from the other recording devices as well. I'm also here to investigate this case, and this data is more important than anything else!
Doing_String=Say, my request for you isn't too much to ask, is it?
Completable_String1=We need the second and third batches of data. Then, the fourth device is broken.
Complete_String=(Baraex Individual Quest) (11/22)<br>I was about to take off with the replacement part when the Investigator stopped me and asked me for copies of data from the other recording devices for his investigation.
List_String=(Baraex Individual Quest) (11/22)<br>Repair the broken power generator and run the second recording device.

[Quest_201932]
Name=(T) Kalimantas Mine
Occur_String1=Did you check where the machine is broken?
Occur_String2=(Pointing at the picture of the power generator) <br>Here. I think it just needs a new part, like the last one.
Occur_String3=Hm. That part... Give me a moment.
Occur_String4=Now, this is where you can find the materials for that part! And like the last time, they can only be found in another world on the other side of the Rift!
Occur_String5=I'll bring them right away.
Doing_String=Wow, how commendable! You're awfully diligent! Lowly researchers like me can't even compare to someone like you! It's like the gods must have sent you to help me!
Completable_String1=Kalimantas ores! The value of these ores... It's probably better you don't know.
Complete_String=(Baraex Individual Quest) (12/22)<br>I told the investigator about the damaged parts in the fourth power generator. Like the last time, he said that I had to go to another dimension to find the materials for the replacement parts. He then gave me the location of the Rift connected to that dimension.
List_String=(Baraex Individual Quest) (12/22)<br>Move to the Kalimantas Mine, defeat monsters, and collect the ores.
Mission_String=Move to the Breath of the World Tree - North and look for the Kalimantas Mine
Mission_Target1=Collect Kalimantas Ores

[Quest_201933]
Name=(T) Replace Parts
Occur_String1=Here's the next replacement part. Wow, it's as beautiful as a gemstone, made of the kalimantas ores. Isn't it?
Occur_String2=.. It looks more complex than that last part. Can I just insert it into the machine?
Occur_String3=Oh, I forgot to tell you about that. Open this part, insert the part, and turn it this way! It should fit like a glove!
Doing_String=As far as I know, there's a total of 10 recording devices in this lab!
Completable_String1=Fourth, fifth... Then, this must be the last batch of data!
Complete_String=(Baraex Individual Quest) (13/22)<br>The investigator said there's a total of 10 recording devices in this lab. I hope at least one of the three remaining devices contains the truth about the case.
List_String=(Baraex Individual Quest) (13/22)<br>Repair the broken power generator and run the recording devices.

[Quest_201934]
Name=(T) Last Part
Occur_String1=As you see in the video, Baraex was with a female scientist. It's obvious that they were very close. I think she must be Aria, who he's mentioned before.
Occur_String2=. . . . Ah, is that right?
Occur_String3=(What was it? His attitude just changed, just very slightly.) <br>And... someone was spying on them.
Occur_String4=Mm, I see! I'd better watch the video myself later. <br>By the way, did you check where the machine is broken?
Occur_String5=(Pointing at the picture of the power generator) <br>Here. It's not damaged too badly.
Occur_String6=Good! Then, give me just a moment.
Occur_String7=There is it! You'll have to go to another world through the Rift again!
Occur_String8=. . . Mm, alright. <br>(It seems like he's in a hurry all of a sudden. Am I just imagining it?)
Doing_String=. . . . Oh, you're still here.
Completable_String1=This ore here would make some really nice jewelry. <br>It's beautiful, isn't it?
Complete_String=(Baraex Individual Quest) (14/22)<br>When I said that the female scientist in the video from the fifth recording device could be the Aria that Baraex mentioned, the investigator's attitude changed slightly. And he started acting as if he was in a hurry, which bothered me.
List_String=(Baraex Individual Quest) (14/22)<br>Move to the Copal Mine, defeat monsters, and collect the ores.
Mission_String=Move to Wellspring Haven and look for the Copal Mine.
Mission_Target1=Collect Copal Ores

[Quest_201935]
Name=(T) The Real Perpetrator
Occur_String1=I hope this last batch of data can reveal the truth behind this case.
Occur_String2=Then, please make a copy of data, as usual!
Doing_String=The last batch of data and the identity of the real culprit! Exciting, isn't it?
Completable_String1=Finally, we've got the sixth and last batch of data. Good job! <br>So, does it show who the real culprit is?
Completable_String2=As you may have guessed already, Baraex wasn't the real culprit. <br>It's this other scientist in the video. We have to find him.
Completable_String3=I see! Finally, we can find out who the real culprit is! Hey, do you mind doing something else for me? I'll give you a gift that you've never seen before!
Completable_String4=Ah no, thanks. I'm done doing what I came here for, and I have no plan to come back here unless I absolutely have to. Good luck with your investigation.
Completable_String5=Oh. How disappointing! But I'll look forward to seeing you again!
Complete_String=(Baraex Individual Quest) (15/22)<br>The last video showed what happened in the Restricted Area on that day. It proved that Baraex wasn't the culprit like I thought he was. He was another victim. There was, however, another scientist who was arguing with the female scientist, Aria. I must find him. Gildan at the Ruins Management Office should know who he is.

[Quest_201936]
Name=(T) Who is the Real Perpetrator?
Occur_String1=You came. Did you reactivate all the recording devices in the lab?
Occur_String2=Some of the power generators were broken, so it took me a while to repair them. <br>But I managed to reactivate them all and saw the face of the real culprit in the last video I watched.
Occur_String3=.. That's strange. All of them were in working order when I left the lab. Oh, do you remember the face of the real culprit?
Occur_String4=He had some pretty vicious-looking eyes compared to the other scientists there. A broad forehead, slightly upturned corners at his mouth. He actually looked kind of like a snake.
Occur_String5=He must be the senior researcher, Kunan. This explains why the power generators were broken. Have you seen anyone else in the Restricted Area?
Occur_String6=Two investigators. The latter one gave me replacement parts for the power generators and asked me for copies of data from the recording devices.
Occur_String7=Mm... Didn't you notice anything suspicious about him?
Occur_String8=His attitude changed when I said that a female scientist in a video could be the woman named Aria, whom Baraex mentioned. Other than that, nothing.
Occur_String9=Aria... It was an open secret that Kunan had a crush on her. I think you should be really careful with that investigator.
Occur_String10=And... I'm really sorry to ask you this, but I'd like to have copies of their data as well. If all the devices are in operation, you should be able to copy the data from all the devices through the last device. If some of them are broken, however, you'll have to repair them all.
Doing_String=Kunan was the leader of the researchers in the lab. He had a way with words and could easily manipulate the others. It also bothers me that some of the power generators were broken.
Completable_String1=Ooh! Look who's here! I didn't think we'd meet again so soon. How amazing!
Complete_String=(Baraex Individual Quest) (16/22)<br>Gildan told me that the man in the last video was a senior researcher named Kunan. He said that Kunan was very meticulous and could have broken the power generators to hide his guilt. He warned me to be wary of the Investigator in the Restricted Area.

Name=(T) Broken Machine
Occur_String1=Do you still have the data from the recording devices I gave you?
Occur_String2=Ah, no, I'm sorry, I sent away all the storage devices that I had to the State for a more thorough examination. If only you came just a bit earlier... I'm so sorry about this! I want to cry! *Sniffle*
Occur_String3=.. It's okay. I'll just go copy them myself again. Keep up the good work.
Occur_String4=Oh! I've got bad news: most of the power generators that you worked so hard to repair are broken again! The mutants! They started going on a rampage soon after you left.
Occur_String5=.. That's a little bit shocking. Oh, well. <br>Should I get the same parts again?
Occur_String6=That's right! You're so strong <br>that it shouldn't be too difficult for you to get them again!
Doing_String=Burotonium, Kalimantas, Copal! Ah... Just the thought of them makes me feel like I'm in heaven.
Completable_String1=Excellent! Outstanding! With this much ore, I should be able to make any parts you need! If not, you can just go ahead and kill me!
Complete_String=(Baraex Individual Quest) (17/22)<br>I asked the investigator for the copied data from the video-recording devices. He said he had sent all his storage devices to the State for a more thorough examination. I was about to make another tour around the rooms, copying the data, when the investigator said the recording devices were broken again because of the rampaging mutants in the lab and that I should get their parts again.

Name=(T) Re-repaired Power Generators
Occur_String1=This time, it was much more difficult to collect the materials. <br>The monsters have grown stronger than before.
Occur_String2=They're in different dimensions, and they're probably desperate to protect what belongs to them. <br>They could be on high alertâ€” Oh? That really makes sense, doesn't it?
Occur_String3=Anyway, it doesn't matter. I've got the materials. <br>Now, please make the parts for me.
Occur_String4=...Okay, thank you for waiting. I don't know where exactly they're broken, but these parts should fix most of the damage.
Occur_String5=.. Got it. Then, I'll be saying goodbye for now.
Occur_String6=Oh, how sad! But life is unpredictable, right? But just like how you came back unexpectedly this time, I'm sure we'll meet again someday! Actually, we must!
Doing_String=Oh, are you sad about parting, too?
Completable_String1=Sir knight! Sir knight! Wait, wait! I've got something important to tell you!
Complete_String=(Baraex Individual Quest) (18/22)<br>I told the investigator that it was more difficult to get the part materials through the Rift this time. He glossed over it, saying that the monsters must be on high alert. I didn't think it mattered, so I just repaired the broken machines with the replacement parts that he created. When I was about to leave the Restricted Area, he stopped me and said he had something important to say to me.

Name=(T) Resurrected Raging Test Subject
Occur_String1=I don't think I have any business with you anymore.
Occur_String2=Sorry, but it's something only you can do! <br>So, please. Just hear me out, please?
Occur_String3=.. Make it short, if that's even possible.
Occur_String4=After you left, I examined the situation inside by using the precise mechanical device I brought with me. You know, to fulfill my duty as an investigator! While I was at it, I've detected vital signs of a massive creature buried deep under the Restricted Area!
Occur_String5=.. Aw, no, has that massive test subject resurrected!?
Occur_String6=But I didn't call you to stop, simply because I discovered the creature! That creature is growing bigger by the minute! It's only a matter of time before it breaks out of this place, into the world!
Occur_String7=Your regular army is too busy fighting the Noria Army. <br>And I doubt the elves would agree to combine their forces just for this.
Occur_String8=That's right! That's why I really need your help this time!
Occur_String9=.. Alright, but I expect to be paid better than whatever you're planning right now.
Doing_String=Of course! I'll pay you out of my own pocket if I must!
Completable_String1=Ooh! Incredible! Absolutely incredible! You defeated that massive monster!
Complete_String=(Baraex Individual Quest) (19/22)<br>I was about to leave with the copied data from the video-recording devices for Gildan at the Ruins Management Office, but then the dispatched investigator waylaid me about something urgent. It turned out the test subject from the isolated testing room has resurrected and is rapidly growing bigger. After I defeated it again, with great difficulty, the investigator walked toward me with a troubled look in his eyes.

Name=(T) Revealed Truth
Occur_String1=.. Investigator, how did you come hereâ€” You followed me, like the last time, didn't you? <br>This place is still dangerous, and this isn't the first time that test subject has resurrected.
Occur_String2=Ah, I'm not worried about that. I'm actually worried about a much more dangerous creature... You.
Occur_String3=.. What are you talking about?
Occur_String4=This place should've stayed locked down, forever! The air inside it is contaminated by mutation-causing spores, which have turned everyone and everything inside it into dangerous, violent mutants!
Occur_String5=There are some research materials left inside the lab, yes, but they're not worth risking more people's lives!
Occur_String6=That's absolutely right! Before you stepped in, no one in the State dared risk their life to learn the truth about this place. If it weren't for you, it could've been buried forever, like I planned it to be!
Occur_String7=You... Have you lost your mind!?
Occur_String8=Ah, yes! I have! The day my beautiful Aria defiled herself by consorting with that mongrel, my mind shattered like broken glass!
Doing_String=Anyway, it's time to really give you the gift that I mentioned before!
Completable_String1=Anyway, it's time to really give you the gift that I mentioned before!
Complete_String=(Baraex Individual Quest) (20/22)<br>I didn't know how, but the investigator came through the throngs of mutants roaming the lab and showed up in front of me. I told him this place was dangerous because the test subject could resurrect again. He laughed and said that I was more dangerous to him than the test subject itself.

Complete_String=(Baraex Individual Quest) (21/22)<br>The investigator finally showed his true colors and tried to kill me to keep the secret of the Restricted Area hidden. Then, Baraex showed up all of a sudden and turned him into a mound of ash. He swore revenge for himself and Aria on the Ashases and said that he would not stop until every single Ashas disappeared from the face of the earth. I had no choice but to defeat him again, but I wonder if I made the right decision. This might keep me awake at night for a long time.

Name=(T) Belated Regret
Occur_String1=That investigator I told you about the other day... He was the scientist Kunan, the real culprit. He finally revealed his true colors and tried to kill me, but then Baraex appeared out of nowhere and killed him.
Occur_String2=Oh, no. Is Baraex still alive?
Occur_String3=I don't know if he's alive or dead. Baraex accumulated so much energy in his body that he turned into a mass of energy himself. As soon as he burned Kunan to death, he told me that he'd kill all Ashases and warned me not to interfere.
Occur_String4=I had to get rid of him, but now that he's just a mass of energy, he can come back to life anytime if he can recharge.
Occur_String5=Baraex... Aria... <br>Maybe the person who was responsible for all this was killed too soon.
Occur_String6=In a way, yes. And this is a shame, but Baraex wouldn't be able to get out of that lab. He has to be where he can get enough energy to sustain himself, and I doubt there's anywhere else he can do that.
Occur_String7=Perhaps not. And by the way, <br>did you bring the data from the video-recording devices I asked you?
Occur_String8=You didn't forget that, did you? Here.
Occur_String9=With this, I'll be able to restore Baraex's honor. If only I were braver and had done this sooner... I hope I'm not too late.
Occur_String10=It's never too late. And Baraex would appreciate you for being so brave. He'd be happy, just for the fact that you're trying to do something for him.
Completable_String1=Thank you for your help so far. I'll be looking for a way to bring Baraex back to normal. I'm really glad that he's still alive.
Complete_String=(Baraex Individual Quest) (22/22)<br>I defeated Baraex and returned to Gildan to tell him what happened. Gildan was surprised that Baraex was still alive and thanked me for my help. Scientist Kunan, who perpetrated the crime, died too soon. His victims, Aria and Baraex, were still living, but in excruciating pain. Even so, their associate Gildan was grateful that they were still alive and said that he'd find some way to bring them back to normal.

Name=(T) Return the Book
Occur_String1=Oh, welcome! I've been wanting to tell you something and ask for a favor.
Occur_String2=Then, let me know what you want to tell me first.
Occur_String3=You might not be interested in this, but the greatest intellectual heritage of us elves, the Sapientia Library, has been opened to the public. Originally, it was only open to the Nobility and a few other privileged elves, and I didn't like that.
Occur_String4=Wow, so as the Crown Princess, you've released what used to be a privilege for the Nobility for everyone else.
Occur_String5=Well, in a way, yes. And anyone who's not an elf cannot enter it, but I've decided to make you an exception. Feel free to use it.
Occur_String6=.. Should I be grateful?
Occur_String7=*Sigh...* Ask any scholar on the MU Continent. He'll grab at you, foaming at the mouth out of jealousy. But no, I haven't done that to hear thanks from you.
Occur_String8=Well, alright. Then, what is it that you want to ask me?
Occur_String9=I'm sorry, but do you mind returning this book to the Library? It has just been opened to the general populace, and I don't want to add more stress to its staff by showing up there.
Occur_String10=Now you're sending me on book errands, huh? Sure, why not? The Crown Princess cares about her people so much. I should be glad to help her.
Doing_String=I'm always grateful for you. Don't take this too personally.
Completable_String1=.. It's the book that Princess Lunedill has borrowed.
Complete_String=(Dark Shadow Group Quest) (1/15)<br>Elf villagers now have access to the Sapientia Library, which used to be a privilege only enjoyed by certain elves. The library is still only open to elves, but Lunedill arranged for me to enter the library. Then, Lunedill asked me to return a book that she had checked out from there.
List_String=(Dark Shadow Group Quest) (1/15)<br>Deliver Lunedill's book to Librarian Raniel at the entrance to the Sapientia Library.
Mission_String=Move to the entrance to the Sapientia Library

[Quest_202002]
Name=(T) Lunedill and the Dark Shadows
Occur_String1=.. That's right. If you remember who borrowed the books just by looking at them, you're either extremely smart or the books are extremely valuable. Which one is it?
Occur_String2=You're more shrewd than you look. You're right. You may not be able to read it because it's written in the elven language, but this book contains information about the dark elves.
Occur_String3=(Lunedill is gathering information about the dark elves... to investigate the Dark Shadows?)
Occur_String4=Now you look interested. The fact that Princess Lunedill sent you here proves that she trusts you. Queen Cara is protected by a group of dark elf guards called the Dark Shadow. Gathering information about them can be interpreted as a sign of rebellion.
Occur_String5=.. You're telling me this without batting an eye. Does this mean you're one of Lunedill's people?
Occur_String6=I once was a Shadow Phantom, if that answers your question.
Occur_String7=It does. You sound as if Lunedill sent me here for a reason. I presume you have more things to tell me. Do you?
Occur_String8=Queen Cara, after it was decided that the Library would be open to public, has ordered to store the most controversial books to a separate place called the Forbidden Archive.
Occur_String9=Is it the place in front of us, guarded by the Dark Shadows?
Occur_String10=It's such an important place that it's guarded by the Queen's personal guards, the Dark Shadows. Then, farewell.
Doing_String=I only told you what everyone else knows.
Completable_String1=The Crown Princess called me. She asked me to support you to the best of my ability. What's going on?
Complete_String=(Dark Shadow Group Quest) (2/15)<br>Lunedill sent me to the Library for a reason: there's information about the dark elves sealed within the Forbidden Archive. As the Crown Princess, she can't enter that place herself, so she sent me to the Library instead as her way of asking me for the sealed book.
List_String=(Dark Shadow Group Quest) (2/15)<br>Check the Dark Shadow Guarders standing in front of the Forbidden Archive, and then talk to Iris at the Chaber Fortress Command Center.

Name=(T) Materials to Break the Seal
Occur_String1=I went to the Sapientia Library to return a book for Lunedill. I think she's gathering information about the Dark Shadows.
Occur_String2=.. Recently, Queen Cara's authority has been challenged from inside and outside of her kingdom. The Crown Princess is really determined when she has her mind set on something.
Occur_String3=By the way, is that librarian, Raniel, trustworthy? She told me something interesting today. She said that if I want information about the dark elves, I should check the books in the Forbidden Archive, which is only open to Queen Cara.
Occur_String4=Raniel and I used to be in the Shadow Phantoms together. She's careful and knows how to keep secrets. If she said that to you, then there must be books in the Forbidden Archive that contain information about the dark elves. The problem is, you can't get in there without the Queen's signet.
Occur_String5=Does Queen Cara carry that signet?
Occur_String6=No. Usually her guards, the Dark Shadows, carry it, and I don't feel comfortable getting it from them myself.
Occur_String7=Both you and Lunedill beat around the bush when you need my help. Alright, then where can I find that signet?
Occur_String8=The Dark Shadows have a secret lab in the back of the Sapientia Library, and I think it's in there. And even if you manage to sneak into the Forbidden Archive, you'll need a few materials to break the seal over the book. You'll have to get those materials as well.
Occur_String9=I'll have to charge you a hefty premium for this. For now, tell me where I can find the materials, the location of their lab, and how to get in there. I'll figure out everything else on my own.
Occur_String10=I can tell you about all that right away. And someone has to get the Dark Shadows out of that lab by the time you get to the Library. I'll take care of that. You take care of the rest.
Doing_String=I've thanked you so many times that I'm worried that you might think I'm being insincere about it.
Complete_String=(Dark Shadow Group Quest) (3/15)<br>Iris gave me a piece of paper containing the sources of book-unsealing materials, the location of the Dark Shadows' secret lab, and how to get in there. The source of the first material was on the other side of the Rift that was not far from the Chaber Command Center.

Occur_String3=You either die here or get killed by your queen later. You decide. <br>But if you're smart enough, you'll find a way out of it.
Occur_String4=.. Alright. Her signet is somewhere over there. You're really not going to kill us, are you?

Name=(T) The Dark Elves and the Chaos Crystal Maze
Occur_String1=Soon, the Dark Shadows will come pouring in. We don't have time.
Occur_String2=Okay. I'll read through it as quickly as I can. Just give me a moment...
Occur_String3=Oh, no... According to this book, the dark elves weren't always as dark-skinned as they are now. Their skin was darkened by the corrupting power of a Chaos Crystal that some elf explorers found and let loose among themselves!
Occur_String4=Corrupting power... That sounds similar to the Evil Energy. It turns plants and animals into monsters, you know.
Occur_String5=Exactly. Because of that, the Queen summoned the Sage Council, and they voted to banish the corrupt dark elves from Noria. She then mobilized her army to build a maze around where the Chaos Crystal was found, to keep the other elves away from it.
Occur_String6=A Chaos Crystal... I can think of at least one organization who might want that.
Occur_String7=Unfortunately, that's all I've found out from this book. Didn't you see any other books in the Forbidden Archive?
Occur_String8=There were a few others, but none of them responded to the materials I brought in there with me like that one did.
Occur_String9=I need more information than this. At any rate, it only justifies her reason to bring the Dark Shadows back into Noria. Ah, wait. Maybe we can find an answer in the maze around the Chaos Crystal. When the other Crown Princess candidate, Arwen, went missing, someone suggested that we should search here.
Occur_String10=The location of the Chaos Crystal... Only the Queen and the explorers who discovered it know exactly where it is. And one of the explorers was Guinness, who now is a commander of the Dark Shadows. I'm sorry, but I want you to go to Iris and look for Guinness. I'll follow you after I take care of the most urgent problem here first.
Doing_String=You'd better get out of here before the Dark Shadows arrive.
Completable_String1=I've heard what happened in the Forbidden Archive. It's completely riled up the Dark Shadows.
Complete_String=(Dark Shadow Group Quest) (12/15)<br>The information we found in the first forbidden book was only beneficial to Queen Cara. Despite the urgent situation we were in, Lunedill came up with a solution. She thought there might be an answer in the maze built around the Chaos Crystal.

Name=(T) Secret Documents
Occur_String1=This is urgent. We have to find the Dark Shadow commander, Guinness.
Occur_String2=Even we don't know where such high-ranking Dark Shadows are because it's confidential. Since the Dark Shadows are the Queen's personal guards, the only ones who know their locations are the Queen and the Dark Shadows themselves.
Occur_String3=And I'm really sorry to say this, but you've angered them so much that we don't feel comfortable intervening. We're not ready to go to war with the Queen's personal guards.
Occur_String4=Understood. Then, I'll just have to interrogate them myself and find out where he is.
Occur_String5=Maybe this can help: recently, we've been receiving reports about Dark Shadows terrorizing the Ashases living near the border. Even if there's a little bit of chaos over there, the Dark Shadows won't be able to respond very quickly.
Occur_String6=Good to know. I'll see you later.
Doing_String=The location of Dark Shadow Commander Guinness... What is Princess Lunedill thinking?
Completable_String1=You brought more stuff. Give it to me. <br>I hope it has some useful information...
Complete_String=(Dark Shadow Group Quest) (13/15)<br>I wanted to find Guinness through the Shadow Phantoms' information network, but even their leader Iris didn't know where such high-ranking Dark Shadows were because it was confidential. Iris also said that the Dark Shadows were completely riled up because of what I did in the Forbidden Archive. This made it too risky for the Shadow Phantoms to intervene. So,, I just went to the border area, interrogated the Dark Shadows who terrorized the Ashases living there, and seized a large amount of secret documents from them.

Occur_String1=Say, did you find any good information?
Occur_String2=Those Dark Shadows kept a ledger of the things that they had pillaged from the local Ashases. Lucky for us, they also kept a separate ledger for the more valuable things that they put aside for their boss, Guinness.
Occur_String3=Ah, and it has his contact information, too.
Occur_String4=This is good. Investigating such a high-ranking officer of the Dark Shadows, the personal guards of the Queen, without a valid reason is an obvious act of treason.
Occur_String5=The goddess of fortune watches over those who do the right things. Now that you know where he is, are you and Lunedill going to go to him?
Occur_String6=That's... Well, like I told you before, it's best no one knows that we Shadow Phantoms are involved in this, unless Queen Cara decides to step in. We don't want to be accused of treason before we even try anything.
Occur_String7=Ah, you mean you're just going to dump things on me, again.
Occur_String8=I'm really sorry about that. I'll send word to the princess, so she can meet you when you get there. And... this badge represents her authority. Keep it on you, and even the Dark Shadows wouldn't dare hurt you.
Doing_String=Ah, and you asked me to look into your past... Are you sure you lived on this continent before? I can't find anything on you, no matter how deep I dig.

Occur_String1=Maybe the Queen told him to do this. She could always use me as an excuse to avoid punishing Guinness. What's more important to her was to make sure that no incriminating information is released to the outside.
Occur_String2=I was worried about what she might do to you. In a way, I'm glad this happened. Now come with me to see the Queen. She wouldn't dare threaten us openly, now that I have some evidenceâ€”thanks to youâ€”and Guinness tried to hurt me.
Occur_String3=So, it looks like we've made some real progress. We're doing great together.
Doing_String=Okay, let's go see the Queen.
Completable_String1=I'm happy with how this has ended. I really wanted to put Guinness in front of me and force him to tell me where the Maze is, but I'll put a hold on that. Right now, we have something else to do.

Occur_String2=You want to perform a ritual in this situation? What has he done to help you? Things are already out of hand.<br>It looks like he's done diddly-squat, if you ask me.
Occur_String3=Hah hah hah. Maybe.<br>But you can't complain to your parents for giving birth to you, can you?
Completable_String1=We Ashases are originally from a different dimension, which was destroyed by Pandemonium.<br>We were on the verge of extinction when Bulcan found us and moved us here to the MU continent, so we could carry on our legacy.

Occur_String2=We can't afford a big ritual, given the circumstances, and I'm sure Bulcan will understand.<br>But no matter how minimal a ritual is, it must have three offerings. Currently, they're being prepared by Sage Umon, Elder Oldapa, and Archpriestess Fratanne.<br>First, could you go to Umon and find out how many gold herbs he's got?
Doing_String=I doubt Sage Umon has procured many herbs, given the situation...

Occur_String2=The Rift in the Ice Lake Plains in Litenberg is connected to these ruins called the Frozen Magic Kingdom.<br>It's inhabited by various types of ice elementals that are attracted to its magical energy, and these elementals produce enchanted ice.

Doing_String=The sooner, the better. Thank you.
Completable_String1=Is this enough? I think I've brought a lot.<br>By the way, this ice is incredible. It hardly melts because it's filled with mana. How are you going to use it?
Completable_String2=Ah, thank you. This should be enough for the ritual.<br>This enchanted ice melts when it comes in contact with a halidom we have. Then, I'll spray that water over gold herbs. It's a simple process, but part of a holy ritual. I have to pour my heart into it.

Name=(T) The Wind that Announces the Holy Ritual
Occur_String1=By the look on your face, you must have not prepared that wind essence.<br>I helped Umon and Oldapa at Purin's request. Do you need my help?
Occur_String2=The wind essence, which I have to procure, is used during a prayer to invite the god to the ritual. It sends our message to where Bulcan is. It acts as a messenger, if you will.
Occur_String3=Oh, that actually sounds like it'd be quite a spectacle! A messenger of wind for your prayers.
Occur_String4=When you go in and out of the Rift often enough, you'll arrive in this place called the Skywind Square, and the wind essence is only found there. To get to the Skywind Square, you have to be both lucky and skilled. It's really difficult to get that essence.
Occur_String5=And you don't have enough warriors to send out there.
Occur_String6=Right. I've never had such a hard time procuring the offering. I'll gratefully accept your offer. Please bring me the wind essence. Find the Skywind Square on the other side of the Rift and defeat all the monsters there. The wind essence will be gathered for you naturally.

Completable_String2=They had a hard time getting them,<br>but they'll be ready before the ritual. I helped them to make sure of that.
Completable_String3=I see. I was worried it would be hard to find them, what with the war and all. Bulcan must be watching over us.
Completable_String4=To the outsiders, the way we scatter gold leaves, pour wine, and lie prostrate in prayer must look funny.<br>But everything we do, we do out of our admiration and love for Bulcan, without whom we would not be here. There's a reason why we're a religious nation.
Completable_String5=But even the sturdiest pillar collapses if left neglected. Thanks to you, we're able to hold a ritual for our god and remind ourselves of who we really are.<br>Once again, I thank you as an archpriest of the Ashases.
Complete_String=(Ashas Group Quest) (8/8)<br>The Ashases' faith in Bulcan is stronger and more meaningful than I thought. Purin is right: there's a reason they call themselves a religious nation. A healthy religion helps its followers reach the light at the end of a long, dark tunnel. May this ritual bring light to the Ashases in this dark time.

Occur_String2=I fought him, but I'm afraid his soul is beyond salvation.
Occur_String3=If that was the case, every other Ashas who came in contact with his mind should have fallen prey to the same corrupting energy, but look, none of us is affected.<br>He's fighting the energy of the Demons, his inner darkness, everything that's bad, for one goal: he must protect us Ashases as our pope king.
Occur_String4=I've heard there's holy water handed down among the high-ranking priests of the Dracanses, the children of Bulcan. Could you look into it?<br>As far as I know, the Dracans priest in Ohrdor is a respected leader among them.<br>Perhaps their holy water can help with His Holiness's condition.
Occur_String5=The Dracans priest in Ohrdor... I think I've seen him before. I'll look into it.
Doing_String=Bellias is great. He's the most competent of all our pope kings,<br>which makes this situation all the more serious.

Completable_String4=I'm here on behalf of their consul, Desita. He said that you have some kind of holy water that's handed down among you. Can you tell me about it?
Complete_String=(Bellias Individual Quest) (1/10)<br>Fortunately, the Dracans priest in Ohrdor was friendly toward the Ashases. Then again, both races have strong faith in Bulcan. I just hope their holy water is not something so sacred that they can't share with outsiders.
List_String=(Bellias Individual Quest) (1/10)<br>Consul Desita has asked me to get the holy water handed down among the Dracans priests, to help Bellias fight the evil energy within him. The Ashases need Bellias to recover quickly. I should go to the Dracans priest in Ohrdor.

Name=(T) Bulcan's Sacred Blood
Occur_String1=Mm... You must be talking about Bulcan's Sacred Blood. It's holy water handed down from one generation to the next among us Dracanses. It's the most precious thing we have.<br>We can't just give it to anyone.
Occur_String2=I knew it...
Occur_String3=However...! I'm willing to share our holy water with the Ashases to help them overcome the recent tragedy.
Occur_String4=Great!
Occur_String5=Bulcan's Sacred Blood, however, isn't something that's readily available.
Occur_String6=.....
Completable_String1=It's a combination of essences from the three sacred caves of Bulcan,<br>and only devout warriors of our god can enter these caves.
Completable_String2=Then, how...?
Completable_String3=However...! Our brothers are in danger. This is no time to follow such formalities!
Completable_String4=(Ugh, what's with this guy!?)
Completable_String5=And %s_9_1! Luckily, you're such a great hero that Bulcan gladly welcomes you into his places of worship, even if you don't believe in his grace. Hah hah!
Complete_String=(Bellias Individual Quest) (2/10)<br>I didn't have to worry at all. The Dracans priest, despite his annoying way of talking, agreed to help me get the holy water, Bulcan's Sacred Blood.
List_String=(Bellias Individual Quest) (2/10)<br>Fortunately, the Dracans priest was happy to cooperate. But the way he talks... I don't think he means it, but I don't like the way he leads me on, then changes his mind, over and over again. I'll listen to him, for now.
Mission_String=Learn how to get the holy water
Mission_Target1=Talk to the Dracans priest

Name=(T) Fiercely Righteous Mind
Occur_String1=Bulcan likes valiant warriors, and true valor cannot be achieved without a fervent passion for justice.
Occur_String2=The place that symbolizes this is the sacred lava cave, Bulcan's Fire Chamber.<br>The Rift connected to this cave is in the Weiss Basin on the Enova continent.
Occur_String3=Bring me the Burning Essence of Bulcan from there.<br>Show me your burning passion for justice.
Doing_String=Don't forget: force without justice is violence.
Completable_String1=Incredible! Your burning passion for justice must have reached Bulcan!
Complete_String=(Bellias Individual Quest) (3/10)<br>I collected the Burning Essence of Bulcan and gave it to the Dracans priest. I've discovered one more reason to admire this priest: he can say corny things without batting an eye.
List_String=(Bellias Individual Quest) (3/10)<br>To get the Burning Essence of Bulcan, I must enter Bulcan's Fire Chamber on the other side of the Rift in the Weiss Basin, Enova. I should defeat monsters in the Chamber and collect the Burning Essence of Bulcan for the Dracans priest.

Name=(T) Coolheaded Judgment to Suppress Evil
Occur_String1=You're already a hero who will be forever remembered in MU's history. Let me ask you this: what do you think one needs to be valiant?
Occur_String2=Erm... Never giving up?
Occur_String3=That's an important quality of a hero, yes. However, insisting on going forward, regardless of the situation, can backfire on you.<br>You need coolheaded judgment to suppress evil, or you can confuse valor with foolhardiness.
Occur_String4=The place that symbolizes this is the sacred ice cave, Bulcan's Ice Chamber.<br>You can get there through the Rift in Karolsandria on the Duelden continent.
Occur_String5=Please defeat the monsters in there and bring me the Frigid Essence of Bulcan.<br>Show me how cold and impartial your judgment can be.
Doing_String=Don't forget: one needs coolheaded judgment to stand against evil.
Completable_String1=Incredible! Your coolheaded judgment must have impressed Bulcan!
Complete_String=(Bellias Individual Quest) (4/10)<br>I collected the Frigid Essence of Bulcan and gave it to the Dracans priest. The way he talks... He'd be a great actor or a politician if he didn't become a priest.

Name=(T) Firm Faith against Injustice
Occur_String1=The brave are always on the side of the weak, but being brave all the time can be challenging. Some of the world's most notorious villains used to be good men fighting the good fight.<br>They failed to resist the temptations and threats that had surrounded them for too long, and so they became the traitors that history remembers them to be. It's a shame!
Occur_String2=Betrayal is the greatest sin of all.
Occur_String3=Yes, that's why one needs firm faith against injustice to stay on the right side. The place that symbolizes this is the sacred rock cave, Bulcan's Rock Chamber.<br>You can get there through the Rift in the Sanguine Highlands on the Litenberg continent.
Occur_String4=Bring me the Firm Essence of Bulcan from there.<br>Show me your unshakable faith.
Doing_String=Don't forget: one who has firm faith in justice can stop any evil.
Completable_String1=Incredible! Your firm faith must have satisfied Bulcan!
Complete_String=(Bellias Individual Quest) (5/10)<br>I collected the Firm Essence of Bulcan and gave it to the Dracans priest. I think I'm getting used to listening to his corny way of talking. I don't want it to rub off on me, though.

Occur_String1=With this, I've collected all the essences you need, right?
Occur_String2=That's right. Now I'll use them to create the holy water.<br>*Ahem*
Occur_String3=Dear great Bulcan, here stands a brave warrior who's overcome all your trials.<br>Give him a drop of your blood, so he can make a noble pledge to you.<br>I dedicate these three essences representing your holiness that alleviates our pain, punishes evil, and repels the darkness.<br>Let your blessing reside in him, as it grows into a river of goodness and a sea of greatness!

Here, take it.<br>I'd love to ask you about what you had to do to get all the essences, but I know you have a more pressing matter at hand. You should go.

List_String=(Bellias Individual Quest) (6/10)<br>The sight of the Dracans priest chanting to create Bulcan's Sacred Blood reminded me of a soldier letting out a war cry before battle. He looked every inch the priest of the god of valor that he was.

Name=(T) Bellias's Darkness
Occur_String1=Oh no, he can't keep it down. The Pandemonic energy that has encroached upon him must be resisting the holy water.<br>But it took us so long to get it and come here...
Occur_String2=Then, why don't I enter Bellias's consciousness once again? If I scatter the Pandemonic energy, maybe his body can accept the holy water.<br>You should get out of here as soon as you're done feeding him the water. This place is too dangerous for you. I'll see you outside.

Completable_String1=Thanks to you, His Holiness drank the holy water. I think it's helping, to an extent. I'm relieved.<br>You look unscathed. You're an incredible warrior. If we Ashases had great warriors like you, perhaps things wouldn't have gotten so badly out of hand...
Complete_String=(Bellias Individual Quest) (9/10)<br>Fortunately, Bellias drank the holy water and Desita got out safely. But there was no significant change in Bellias's condition. Then again, if it was so easy to change, the problem would never have gotten this bad.

Name=(T) Pope King's Will
Occur_String1=His Holiness Bellias is the wisest and bravest of all the Ashases I've met. It's an honor to serve him. However, this war broke him, and the evil Pandemonic energy seeped in during his moment of vulnerability and now eats away at him.<br>I was his closest confidant, and even I didn't know that. This is my fault.

I won't be able to do it right away, of course, but I will return to you.<br>I'm not perfect, but as Pope King, I'm not going to bring disgrace to our ancestors. Please wait for me a little longer.

Name=(T) Queen's Token
Occur_String1=You look upset. Is something wrong?
Occur_String2=We're not exactly in a good situation. Her Majesty Cara is getting better, but she's still not in the condition to handle state affairs. Many of the elves are also questioning her leadership because of a series of incidents that happened during the war with the Ashases.
Occur_String3=Well, you're the Princess. Can't you rule in her stead? Maybe you can do it as a regent or something. You have every reason to step in.
Occur_String4=It's not that easy. Her Majesty herself won't let me. That has created this predicament we're in. The Queen doesn't want me to rule on her behalf, but she can't rule on her own, either.<br>I think the only solution left is the Queen's Token.
Occur_String5=The Queen's Token?
Occur_String6=It's a token one must have in order to become queen of Noria. To get it, you have to overcome the trials given to you by these priests called the Token Watchmen.<br>The bearer of this token becomes queen. No matter how great a service one renders to her country, she can never be queen without that token.<br>Of course, if someone's strong enough to distinguish herself, she should be strong enough to overcome the trials of the Token Watchmen.
Occur_String7=The bearer of the Queen's Token can appeal to the Council to hold a royal election.<br>I want to use it to persuade the queen.
Completable_String1=In a situation like this, it's more likely that the Council will elect me as queen than keep Queen Cara. And that's probably not what she wants.<br>I want to show the Queen's Token to her, so she'll have no choice but to let me participate in governing the nation.
Completable_String2=Can't you just become queen? To be honest with you, I don't trust Queen Cara.
Completable_String3=It's too risky. This is a unique situation. HistOrikally, two Queen's Tokens rarely exist in the same era.<br>Besides, her supporters, who are mostly hardliners, still have strong faith in her. I don't want to agitate them and create infighting, especially at a time like this.
Completable_String4=You just want to apply enough pressure to get what you want. You already know Queen Cara's response as well.<br>This is politics, huh? Amazing. You're already thinking so far ahead. There's a reason you're the Princess, Your Highness.
Completable_String5=Hm hm, I suppose this means you appreciate me a bit more than you did before?
Complete_String=(Lunedill Individual Quest) (1/14)<br>Lunedill wants to pressure Queen Cara by invoking the right to request a royal election, which comes with the Queen's Token. She doesn't actually want to become queen because she fears it would agitate Queen Cara or her diehard supporters. Her only desire is to participate in governing the nation. She's putting her ambition aside for the good of Noria. There's a reason she's the princess.
List_String=(Lunedill Individual Quest) (1/14)<br>Queen Cara is in no condition to rule Noria, but she still refuses to let Lunedill step in. This leaves Noria without an actual ruler. Lunedill wants to use an ace up her sleeve, the Queen's Token, to pressure Queen Cara.

He'll report their receipt to Her Majesty and create a Queen's Token for you. Bring the Token to me.<br>That's my request this time.
Occur_String3=So, this is why you wanted to talk to me. Alright, I accept your request. But are you sure I can collect them on your behalf?
Occur_String4=A queen is a ruler.<br>The most important qualities in a ruler are a righteous mind and the ability to find the right people to work for her.<br>That's why using an agent is acceptable. Having the right agent shows the queen's ability and will.
Completable_String1=I see. Then, what should I do now?
Completable_String2=First, meet the Watchman on the south side of Breath of the World Tree. This is my emblem. Show it to him, and he'll tell you what to do.

Occur_String2=She's not exactly my boss. She's more like a friend... no, she's a comrade. I don't serve her, but I'm willing to risk my life for her. I trust her with my life.<br>Her name is Lunedill Diochell, and she's the current princess of Noria. I'm here on her behalf. Here's her emblem.
Occur_String3=You dare to speak Her Highness's name so freely? Are you %s_9_1?
Occur_String4=Princess Lunedill's legitimacy is irrefutable, and as a hero who saved many continents from peril, your valor is also irrefutable.<br>Very well. I'll give you a trial that you must overcome for Her Highness Lunedill.
Occur_String5=The Rift next to me is connected to the Perching Cave of Decay, a land of decomposing corpses.<br>Eliminate the dead that are hungry for living things and the worms that live off their rotting flesh.<br>That's your trial to get the first piece. Now, good luck.
Occur_String6=The dead and their worms? What's the meaning behind that?
Occur_String7=Can you walk into the worst place imaginable and do what you have to do? This trial is to test that.<br>If you can, then it'll show that the queen-in-waiting has a good eye for people.

Occur_String1=I've come for the Queen's Token. Are you the Token Watchman of this place?<br>I've got Lunedill's emblem here.
Occur_String2=Has Her Highness Lunedill finally made up her mind? It's understandable. Her Majesty Cara has cost us too much in the war with the Ashases.
Occur_String3=Well, she's not trying to be queen, but...<br>Anyway, what kind of trial is this?
Occur_String4=This place, Flickering Longing Grave, is where the spirits of warriors and mage vassals are gathered. Their masters are still missing.<br>If that's not fealty, then I don't know what is.
Occur_String5=I'd say it's just regret.
Occur_String6=Well, maybe you're right.<br>Put these warriors and mage vassals to rest, and bring me these crystals called Fealty Lights. Then, I'll give you the second piece of the Queen's Token.
Doing_String=Please put their spirits to rest. When it's because of fealty or regret, it's not good for the dead to remain in this realm.
Completable_String1=You've brought them all. Then, here, it's the second piece of the Queen's Token. Your trial with me is over. You may go to the other Watchman now.
Completable_String2=Why are you giving it to me so easily? You don't know who I am, and I could be lying to you.<br>I might even be plotting against your country.
Completable_String3=As a Token Watchman, my duty is to give challengers a trial and award them with a Token piece if they succeed.<br>It doesn't matter who you are, if you're lying, or what you're thinking. The important thing is that you have overcome the trial.<br>I believe our god doesn't give opportunities or talent to those who don't deserve them.
Completable_String4=You've overcome the trial. That means you're capable, and if you're really doing this for Her Highness Lunedill, she's partially earned the right to become queen.<br>These trials aren't just tests of your skills; they're also tests of destiny. If you or Her Highness Lunedill were taking these trials with intent to hurt others, that means our god has forsaken us.
Completable_String5=Everything is the will of your god, huh?
Completable_String6=Right. But no one can know what kind of destiny they might have. You'll have to constantly hone your skills and overcome trials to realize your true destiny.<br>In that sense, your skills are tied to Her Highness Lunedill's destiny. Now, I hope she and you will collect all the pieces.
Complete_String=(Lunedill Individual Quest) (6/14)<br>I collected those crystals, Fealty Lights, and received the second piece of the Queen's Token from the Watchman. My ability is tied to Lunedill's qualification... It sounds like the same thing that Lunedill said when she first hired me. Is this how the elves think? It's an interesting way of looking at destiny.

Name=(T) Queen's Token - Fourth Piece
Occur_String1=I have been waiting. You can get the fourth piece of the Queen's Token after the trial I have for you.<br>This Rift is connected to Temple of Forgotten Gods, filled with myriad creatures and followers of gods that have long been forgotten, gone corrupt, or even vanished.
Occur_String2=It's pity that they were left behind instead of disappearing along with their gods. Your trial is to punish those poor creatures<br>in the name of Goddess Sapientia and her agent, the Queen-in-waiting.
Occur_String3=And collect afterimages of forgotten gods, artifacts of extinct gods, and scriptures of corrupt gods from them as proof.<br>They'll be purged and treated in the name of the great Goddess Sapientia.
Doing_String=Goddess Sapientia watches over all elves. She watches over their representative, the queen, as well.
Completable_String1=Congratulations on completing the trial.<br>Here's the fourth piece of the Queen's Token, a reward you and the queen-in-waiting have earned.
Completable_String2=If you've collected all the pieces, please go to the Archpriest of the Sapientia Temple.<br>He'll report to the goddess about the birth of a new queen-in-waiting and complete her Queen's Token for you.
Complete_String=(Lunedill Individual Quest) (9/14)<br>I've completed the trial and collected the fourth piece of the Token. What is it like to lose the god that you have worshipped with all your heart? It must be unfathomably painful. I hope those creatures and followers can rest in peace now.
List_String=(Lunedill Individual Quest) (9/14)<br>To get the Queen's Token, I must eliminate the followers and creatures of forgotten, corrupt, and extinct gods in the Temple of Forgotten Gods. I'm close to completing Lunedill's request.

Name=(T) Gathered Queen's Token Pieces
Completable_String1=Welcome to the temple of Goddess Sapientia...<br>Mm? Aren't those the pieces of a Queen's Token? You can't be trying to become queen...<br>Her Highness Lunedill is, isn't she?
Completable_String2=Princess Lunedill is wise and decisive. Somehow, I knew this would happen. But considering her character, I doubt she's gathering these to become queen. She must want them as leverage of some kind.
Completable_String3=You're very insightful.
Completable_String4=You learn a thing or two as you get older and move higher up the ladder.<br>Her Majesty Cara can be a good leader, but not in the current situation. In fact, she's the cause of it.<br>As sad as it is to say, I think she should step down for the peace of the rest of us.
Complete_String=(Lunedill Individual Quest) (10/14)<br>I brought all four pieces of the Queen's Token to the Archpriest of the Sapientia Temple. One look at the pieces, and he instantly figured out why Lunedill had gathered them. There's a reason he's the leader of the temple priests.
List_String=(Lunedill Individual Quest) (10/14)<br>Finally, I've collected all four pieces of the Queen's Token. I should bring them to the Archpriest of the Sapientia Temple on the north side of Breath of the World Tree.
Mission_String=Complete the Queen's Token
Mission_Target1=Talk to the Archpriest of the Sapientia Temple

Name=(T) Completed Queen's Token
Occur_String1=Then, I'll make you a Queen's Token. Could you give me the pieces?
Occur_String2=You make it sound as if it's easy to make.
Occur_String3=Normally, I must prepare and perform a sacred ritual, but our temple is not completely restored since the Ashases' invasion. In fact, I don't know when it'll be completed.<br>Besides, isn't it better for you and Her Highness Lunedill to get it done quickly?
Occur_String4=True.
Occur_String5=Then...<br>Dear Goddess, please bless this child who will bring prosperity to Noria.<br>Let every step she takes give life to the grass, the wind, the trees, the earth, and the water, enriching everything.<br>Make sure this queen produces beautiful hope with her benevolence that embraces all.
Completable_String1=Here, take this Queen's Token. I've blessed it with the power given to me as an agent of Goddess Sapientia.<br>The rightful owner of this token has the right to the throne of Noria.
Completable_String2=You should go now. Her Highness Lunedill must be waiting for you. Please give her strength, as you always do.<br>She must be in the Queen's Audience Chamber in Ethedrean.
Complete_String=(Lunedill Individual Quest) (11/14)<br>The completed Queen's Token that the Archpriest gave to me is surrounded by mysterious energy that makes me feel warm and comfortable. I should deliver it to Lunedill in the Queen's Audience Chamber.
List_String=(Lunedill Individual Quest) (11/14)<br>I must receive the Queen's Token blessed by Goddess Sapientia. The blessing spell sounded like a beautiful, hopeful hymn to my ears.

Completable_String1=%s_9_1? What brings you here?
Completable_String2=Good day, Your Majesty. I came to give something to Princess Lunedill.
Completable_String3=Lunedill. Here it is. Take it.
Completable_String4=That was faster than I thought. Thank you, %s_9_1.
Completable_String5=Isn't that... a Queen's Token!? Are you...?<br>Lunedill Diochell! How dare you!?
Complete_String=(Lunedill Individual Quest) (12/14)<br>Queen Cara hit the roof when she saw Lunedill's Queen's Token, a direct challenge to her royal authority. But to address the current situation and restore peace, someone has to keep Queen Cara in check.
List_String=(Lunedill Individual Quest) (12/14)<br>Finally, I've completed the Queen's Token. I should deliver it to Lunedill.

Name=(T) Lunedill's Confrontation with Queen Cara
Occur_String1=Lunedill Diochell! I'm the queen of this country! How dare you try to defy and oust your queen?<br>Guards! Put this traitor under arrest right now!<br>That contemptible %s_9_1, too!
Occur_String2=I'd be a traitor if I coveted the throne without any legitimacy.<br>I'm the Noria Princess elected by the people and the bearer of a Queen's Token. Do you still think I'm a traitor?
Occur_String3=Grr... Lunedill! How... How dare you!?
Occur_String4=I'm sure you know why I've created this Queen's Token.<br>We have to put an end to the terrible war with the Ashases. We must heal our wounds, mend them while we can.
Occur_String5=Now it's up to you. What would you like to do?
Completable_String1=Your Majesty.
Completable_String2=.....
Completable_String3=Your Majesty.
Completable_String4=...Lunedill. Fine, you win. Do as you please.<br>Just don't forget that I'm still your queen, Noria's queen. This is just... a very special case.
Completable_String5=Of course, Your Majesty. I thank you for your wise decision.<br>I'll do my best as the Princess to help us elves and the Ashases repair our relationship and work together until true peace is returned to Noria.
Completable_String6=.....
Complete_String=(Lunedill Individual Quest) (13/14)<br>As I expected, Queen Cara agreed, though not happily, to let Lunedill temporarily govern her country in her stead. This must have been a great gamble for her since she could lose the throne permanently. She wouldn't even look at Lunedill when she thanked her, which showed how angry she was.
List_String=(Lunedill Individual Quest) (13/14)<br>Queen Cara was infuriated, but Lunedill persuaded her with great aplomb. Even though Lunedill made it sound as if the Queen had a choice, she really didn't. The Lunedill I saw today wasn't the Lunedill I knew; she was the Princess armed with ruthless rationality.

Occur_String1=%s_9_1, could you come to my place? I'll meet you there.
Occur_String2=Sure.
Completable_String1=Whew, I thought my heart was going to explode. I feel so exhausted that I can barely stand on my feet.<br>This is all thanks to you, %s_9_1. I really appreciate your help. I couldn't have done it if it weren't for you.
Completable_String2=No. I'm more impressed by you. I feel as if I've seen what you're really like as the Princess.<br>Now, what are you going to do?
Completable_String3=Hah hah. You flatter me. There are many things to do, making up with the Ashases, coping with the after effects of war, rounding up the Dark Mission... *Sigh*<br>I've got my work cut out for me.
Completable_String4=Just listening to you makes my head spin. Let me know if you need me. I'll help you whenever, however long it takes.
Complete_String=(Lunedill Individual Quest) (14/14)<br>Seeing the relaxed expression on Lunedill's face, I finally feel relieved. But this is just one step toward reconciliation between the elves and the Ashases. Lunedill has a huge burden on her shoulders. I want to help her in any way I can to lessen the burden.

Name=(T) Test of the Gods
Occur_String1=You, %s_9_1.
Occur_String2=...What brings an angel to me?
Occur_String3=You're not surprised or in awe to see an angel.
Occur_String4=It's not surprising when you look like the typical angel I see everywhere. And I'm not fond of your bosses, either.<br>So, why did they send you?
Occur_String5=You're definitely not ordinary. That's probably why they decided to let you take their test.<br>%s_9_1, you have an opportunity to pass the test of the gods and receive a precious gift from them.
Occur_String6=The test? What test? What made the gods want to do this all of a sudden?
Occur_String7=The Heavens have been watching you. The gods have been impressed by your superhuman strength, superb skills,<br>and determination to realize justice.
Occur_String8=Pass the test, and you'll be granted an incredible reward. But you don't have to take it if you don't want to.<br>Now, what do you want to do? Do you want to take up the challenge?
Completable_String1=Bah, I can't say no if you're egging me on like this.<br>What's this test, exactly?
Completable_String2=Good choice. I knew you'd welcome the challenge.
Completable_String3=Your test from the Heavens is to subjugate the corrupt Dragon King Kaizel and Targash, the Incomplete Spectral Dragon.<br>They defied their noble destiny to stand by the gods and chose the path of evil. The gods have decided these evil dragons must be punished.
Completable_String4=I should inform you of the honorable reward that you will receive if you pass this test.<br>Talismans carrying the powers of your targets, Kaizel and Targash: they're the gift from the gods to you.
Completable_String5=Talismans carrying the powers of great, powerful dragons like that?<br>Damn, I don't want to sound materialistic, but that's really tempting.
Completable_String6=It's not materialistic to want a reward from the gods. They've allowed you to take this test and get the reward if you pass.<br>It's only natural that you want it.
Complete_String=(Kaizel/Targash Individual Quest) (1/6)<br>My test from the Heavens is to subjugate the corrupt Dragon King Kaizel and Targash, the Incomplete Spectral Dragon. And if I pass, I'll get Talismans carrying their powers. Knowing how powerful Talismans are, I'm definitely interested in this challenge. Also I'm not doing anything wrong. Alright, I'll dance to the gods' tune this time.
List_String=(Kaizel/Targash Individual Quest) (1/6)<br>In the Wallkreiger Ruins on the Litenberg continent, I met an angel in front of the Sanctum of Dragon Knights. The angel said that the gods had been watching me and decided that I was qualified to take their test. So far, the gods haven't done anything to make me like them, but I don't want to say no to this. I can't let them think I'm too scared to take up their challenge.

Name=(T) Vessels for the Powers
Occur_String1=Lava can't be contained in a bowl of ice. To turn the two dragons' powers into Talismans, the vessels that will hold them must be just as strong as they are.
Occur_String2=Before the subjugation of the two evil dragons, I want you to bring the vessels for their power.<br>Behind the Rift, as you call it, different forces from different points in spacetime mingle and collide with each other, shattering into pieces. And I want you to bring the pieces, the Spacetime Bits.
Occur_String3=But there are many Rifts. Where exactly can I get them?
Occur_String4=The forces on the other side of the Rift fight one another for survival. Spacetime Bits are the byproduct of their struggle. You can find them anywhere, so long as it's on the other side of the Rift.
Occur_String5=Spacetime Bits, however, are attracted to the power of the strongest entity in a place; to get them, you must get rid of the entity first. I'm sure that won't be difficult for you: you've already survived many battlefields on the other side of the Rift.
Doing_String=Everyone wants power, but not many are willing to pay the price.
Completable_String1=You've brought them all. Then it's time you subjugate the evil dragons and get your reward.<br>Are you ready?
Completable_String2=As ready as I'll ever be.

List_String=(Kaizel/Targash Individual Quest) (2/6)<br>To collect the powers of the two dragons and turn them into Talismans, I first have to find the ingredients to make the vessels to hold their powers. They're called Spacetime Bits found on the other side of the Rift, and they're sometimes dropped from the rulers of battlefields there. That means I'll be going in and out of the Rift for a while.

[Quest_202403]
Name=(T) Fallen Dragon King, Kaizel
Occur_String1=The ancient dragon Kaizel is the progenitor of the Dracans, the children of Bulcan. It once was the subject of their worship and even called the Dragon King. But the light of its glory was extinguished a long time ago. What's left now is an evil, fallen dragon that hates its degradation of glory and lives for revenge.
Occur_String2=Punish the fallen Dragon King Kaizel in the name of the gods. The gods have faith in you.<br>Collect the soul pieces that form Kaizel's reverse scales, and you will also get a reward for this additional duty.
Occur_String3=Remember: you must prove your complete subjugation of Kaizel. You'll also need its complete power to create a Talisman.<br>To achieve this, you must fight it on the most difficult battlefield there is.
Occur_String4=Okay, I'll bring them at all costs.
Doing_String=Subjugate Kaizel and bring Reverse Scale Soul Pieces. Prove your strength.
Completable_String1=You're as impressive as I thought. You subjugated the fallen Dragon King Kaizel and collected your reward on your own.<br>I acknowledge your valor. Here, please take this Talisman of Kaizel.
Completable_String2=What amazing power! It holds the power that can decide the life or death of everything in the world.<br>What made such a powerful dragon fall so low?
Completable_String3=The Dracans who established the Wallkreiger Kingdom worshipped Kaizel, and under its protection, they grew arrogant. Their arrogance caused friction among their ranks, giving an opening to the Demons and a black-magic cult named the Dark Mission.<br>Kaizel couldn't resist their dark temptation.
Completable_String4=Can gods be affected by their own creations?
Completable_String5=Of course they can. Followers can't exist without a god to follow, and a god who has lost all its followers becomes forgotten. And being forgotten is as good as not existing at all.<br>Our Creator Akneria must be the only god who can exist unsupported.
Complete_String=(Kaizel/Targash Individual Quest) (3/6)<br>Kaizel's Talisman is carrying an incredible power. I can't imagine how powerful Kaizel must have been in its prime. But Kaizel fell along with the Wallkreiger Kingdom. They did it to themselves, but still it's a shame that it happened.

Name=(T) Targash, the Incomplete Spectral Dragon
Occur_String1=Your next test from the gods is to subjugate Targash, the Incomplete Spectral Dragon.<br>Its original destiny wasn't as horrible as its current one, but things don't always go as planned.
Occur_String2=It wasn't time for this dragon to wake up, but the Demon invaders of this place and their colluders, the Garudas, forcibly removed the Neria's Tears that were here.
Occur_String3=You mean the thing that creates dragons?
Occur_String4=Yes. Having lost the Neria's Tears, Targash was destroyed before it had a chance to realize its destiny. Now, it's engulfed in hatred and anger, and it is only driven by its resentment and despair. Its sole purpose is to destroy all creatures that were made whole.<br>What happened to it is sad, but the gods have decided that the dragon must be dealt with.
Occur_String5=And your duty is to put Targash to rest and collect the bone chips that could've become its reverse scales. But...
Occur_String6=But, to perfectly subjugate Targash and collect his power, I must enter the toughest battlefield there is, right?
Occur_String7=That's right. Then I'll count on you to carry out the gods' will without fail.
Doing_String=You can give up if you want. But I know your honorable spirit wouldn't allow it.
Completable_String1=Targash will never wake up again. I've brought all the reverse scale bone chips as you asked, too.<br>The power in these chips... It's rather terrifying.
Complete_String=(Kaizel/Targash Individual Quest) (5/6)<br>The hulking body of Targash collapsed at last, and I took its reverse scale bones to the angel. How powerful is Targash's Talisman? I'd be lying if I said I wasn't looking forward to finding out.
List_String=(Kaizel/Targash Individual Quest) (5/6)<br>Targash, the Incomplete Spectral Dragon was destined to become a perfect dragon, but the Demons and the Garudas ruined that by getting rid of the Neria's Tears.

Occur_String2=The power in this Talisman... I feel as if I've got the power of an army. It's a totally unrelenting kind of power...
Completable_String1=You've passed the test of the gods with flying colors and collected your reward on your own. All I did was contain it for you. Everything else was your doing.
Completable_String2=The gods see everything, and they pay special attention to you. Please try not to end up like Targash or Kaizel.
Completable_String3=That's never going to happen.
Completable_String4=I'm glad to hear that. Continue to walk the path of righteousness, and the gods might give you another test. So, don't slack on your training.<br>Now may the gods bless you on your journey.
Complete_String=(Kaizel/Targash Individual Quest) (6/6)<br>The test of the gods ended, leaving me with two powerful Talismans. I was told other gods are also watching me. I'm not doing what I do to satisfy the gods, but if they want to give me more tests like this, I'm all for it.

Occur_String1=Hm? Why are you still here? I thought you'd be done here once you collected the data boxes.
Occur_String2=I should've been, but I've got a message from another investigator on Crescent Moon Island. He's detected powerful Pectra Energy responses so far out in the sea.<br>My instructions are to wait here for now, in case he needs my support.<br>If you're interested, you should go there.
Occur_String3=Last time, you told me to leave you alone. Why are you telling me everything this time?
Occur_String4=Well... First, you're trustworthy, and second, I could use your help to speed things up, so I could...
Occur_String5=So, you could go home quickly.
Occur_String6=Well, yes. So, personally, I'd like to ask you for help.<br>We've built a temporary dock at the northern end of Crescent Moon Island. You'll see a Kanturian investigator there.

Completable_String1=Ah, %s_9_1? Groanz has messaged me. He said help was on the way.
Completable_String2=Darn it, he pulled a fast one on me.
Completable_String3=I've heard a lot about you. Even Estesia and Kalak kept saying good things about you.
Completable_String4=I see. I haven't heard those names for a long time. How are they?

List_String=(Gabriela Individual Quest) (1/10)<br>I noticed that the Kanturian, Groanz, whom I helped the last time, was still in Noria. He said he couldn't leave because of the sudden Pectra Energy responses detected around Crescent Moon Island. He went straight to the point and asked for my help. I'd take a little bit of brazenness over a lot of ambiguity anytime. Perhaps I should go to the island and check those energy responses if I have time.

Name=(T) Forgotten Ark of Ancient Kanturians
Occur_String1=See the island in the distance? That's not an island; it's an ark that just surfaced all of a sudden.<br>The ancient Kanturians built large-size research vessels and used them to travel by sea, by air, and even across dimensions to study various civilizations and technologies.
Occur_String2=While they were doing that, they expanded and improved their research vessels, turning them from simple ships and aircrafts into big floating cities that were completely self-sufficient and even armed with self-defense and emergency response systems.<br>They're called the Arks. They're the essence of the ancient Kanturian technology.
Occur_String3=If they're ancient, they can't be technologically more advanced than modern vessels.
Occur_String4=In most cases, yes. But we Kanturians are the children of Akneria. We advanced our technology with her blessing. That was why Ancient Kanturu was able to create such an overwhelmingly superior technological civilization.<br>No technology that currently exists on the MU continent can compete with what went into making that Ark. Honestly, our most advanced technology is child's play compared to the Ark.
Occur_String5=We found a path into the Ark, but the internal defense system and some unknown entities started attacking us. So, we stopped the investigation. For now, we're waiting for help from our country.
Occur_String6=%s_9_1, I'd like you to enter the Ark and investigate its interior. We can't enter because we're not really fighters.<br>I've arranged a ship to the Ark for you. Thank you in advance.
Doing_String=Ah, are you prone to motion sickness? No worries, I've prepared a big bottle of anti-nausea elixir.
Completable_String1=Isn't it amazing? Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic, as the saying goes. It's truly marvelous to me that the whole structure is the product of immaculate arithmetic calculations and algorithms and not magic or a miracle.
Completable_String2=Definitely. I don't know much about your technology, but even to me, it looks like a magical or miraculous world full of unimaginable beings.<br>But if you had such powerful technology, how come you're still...?
Completable_String3=How come we're still living in a corner of Litenberg, you ask?<br>Because of the Divine War.<br>When Sekneum organized the Pandemonium Army and invaded, Akneria and all her children resisted him together.
Completable_String4=During that war, the Kanturian Arks were used as powerful weapons, and of course, the Demons attacked them before everything else.<br>Earth won the war, but all our Arks were destroyed, leaving us to... decline to this point.
Completable_String5=And fortunately for you, one Ark sank not far from the shores of Noria... and it has just resurfaced.
Completable_String6=Yes, and I can't describe how excited we are for its discovery. This is our chance to restore the glory and stature of Ancient Kanturu.<br>It must be the last gift for us from Akneria, who perished after saving all of us.
Complete_String=(Gabriela Individual Quest) (2/10)<br>That space, unlike anything I'd ever seen, was filled with a mysterious fluorescent light and made of some unknown metal, which was smooth but not cold to the touch. And the Ark, from up close, was as big as a city. How did it fly in the sky and travel across dimensions? What kind of people were the Ancient Kanturians?
List_String=(Gabriela Individual Quest) (2/10)<br>The Ark combines all the technologies of the race created by Akneria herself... What kind of a place is it? I can't even imagine. Kanturu today has the most advanced technology on the MU continent, but its technical accomplishments are child's play compared to what went into making the Ark. I'll have to go see it for myself.

[Quest_202503]
Name=(T) Check Elements of Danger
Occur_String1=To investigate the Ark, you first must neutralize its internal defense system. Of course, that system is also the target of our research and investigation.
Occur_String2=However, there is another problem. There are unknown enemies in there, and I've never seen them before while studying Ancient Kanturu. Honestly, I don't think they have anything to do with Ancient Kanturu,<br>but I can't completely ignore the possibility of them being the products of Ancient Kanturian technology that surpass our knowledge.
Occur_String3=Please bring me the circuitries and other parts of the machines operated by the Ark's internal defense system and the remains of those unknown enemies. Those enemies can be classified into three different types, depending on their shape. Please bring all the types.
Doing_String=I want to know how this Ark has resurfaced or sank in the first place. Perhaps those unknown enemies have clues to the answers I seek.
Completable_String1=The circuitries and components you brought definitely belong to Ancient Kanturu. But the remains of the unknown enemies...
Completable_String2=They're strange, even to me. But they're not of an evil nature, like Pandemonium or black magic.
Completable_String3=I agree. No two pieces of remains look the same, but the energies that they radiate are similar to something priests would refer to as divine power. This is completely unexpected. Is it possible gods like Bulcan and Rugard were involved in the making of this Ark?
Completable_String4=So far, those two gods have done nothing to help us, and I doubt that would change now. But I know these monsters are nothing like I've seen before.

Name=(T) More Evidence
Occur_String1=We need more samples related to the Ark that I can study. Think you can find an entity inside the Ark that's stronger than the others?
Occur_String2=If you can, please bring me whatever you can find from itâ€”essences, fragments, its spirit, energy, you name it.
Occur_String3=We don't have much information about holy power. The followers of the gods think that our effort to collect data about their gods is sacrilegious.<br>It's not like I don't understand them, but...
Occur_String4=If someone made the Ark resurface, then the enemies that I've fought so far can't be the only ones in there. There has to be someone else who's stronger.<br>I'll look for them.
Doing_String=Nothing in life is easy, is it?
Completable_String1=There were stronger ones, just as we expected. And the things I've found from them are definitely different.<br>There's no energy meter, and their energy is so mysterious that it even touched me, and I'm an atheist. Is this what you mean by holy power?
Completable_String2=Yes. Please give them to me and wait while I examine them. I should be able to get the results right away.

Occur_String1=%s_9_1, were these formidable enemies you fought identical, in the sense of their appearances or type? Or did they use the same skills?
Occur_String2=No. They were all different.
Occur_String3=Then, this is more bizarre. Everything you've brought is imbued with the same power, which means they should all be the same type, but you said they're not. Then, there's only one answer:<br>these enemies originate from a single entity.
Occur_String4=There's something that I thought was suspicious. All the enemies I fought in there were familiar to me. I met them in the Heavens. Anilata, Deosizer, Aveeter... <br>Is it possible someone in there knows me? Or can this be a simple coincidence?
Completable_String1=My first thought is that someone who knows you well must have reproduced those enemies with their power.<br>How strong were they compared to the last time you fought them?
Completable_String2=...Stronger than before.

Occur_String3=I'm Gabriela. Let's just say I'm an angel... mostly.
Occur_String4=You want to know my purpose, don't you? It's simple, %s_9_1. I wanted to meet you, so I salvaged that Ark, to use it as a stage.<br>Impressive, isn't it? You and I deserve a good stage like that, don't you think?
Occur_String5=My goodness! You've recovered such a great creation for a reason like that...!?
Occur_String6=...You want to fight me. Why?
Occur_String7=I'm not the chatty type. You can either fight me or not.<br>What's wrong, are you afraid? I thought you were the world's greatest warrior who butchered countless Demons and monsters.<br>Besides, I had to jump through some hoops to dredge that thing. Come on, don't get cold feet on me.
Occur_String8=I don't care what you think. And why would I fight you? What's in it for me?
Occur_String9=Well, you may not gain anything, but you can definitely lose something. Let's see...
Occur_String10=How about I decorate Ethedrean with that Ark, hmm? It'd make a fine spectacle, don't you think?
Completable_String1=...What?
Completable_String2=I could lift it up, shoot it through the sky, and drop it right onto Ethedrean.<br>Wouldn't that be lovely?
Completable_String3=Are you crazy!?
Completable_String4=No, you can't!
Completable_String5=Well, I knew you'd say that. It's what most people would say.<br>But you see, interesting things happen in this world all the time, some of them beyond your imagination. Am I wrong?
Completable_String6=You decide. Either you play with me, or I'll play with your world.<br>I prefer the former, but if you chose the latter... well, I'd be disappointed, but I could always make myself feel better by dumping that thing onto your city.

Occur_String3=But if she really has control over the Ark and really created those formidable entities of the Heavens, then... she could mean business. The Ark is designed to travel anywhere, even across dimensions. That is, it can move.<br>And even if it can't, I'm sure that angel, judging by the determination I sensed in her, will make it move, no matter what.
Occur_String4=Drat! You've got to be kidding me! I have to go.<br>Even if she's ninety percent joking, there's still a ten percent chance that she decides to raze Ethedrean to the ground. I can't gamble with that kind of chance.
Doing_String=Not all angels are good like you hear in the fairytales.
Completable_String1=You came back alive! This must mean you beat Gabriela!
Completable_String2=No. I couldn't even make her sweat, let alone beat her. We were fighting, and suddenly she just put away her sword and vanished, like a child would leave the playground for home.<br>I was fighting for my life, but she was just playing.
Completable_String3=Th-then... Will she really throw the Ark at Ethedrean?
Completable_String4=Oh, come on! I told you I'm an angel... well, mostly. But I'm still a noble being, you know.<br>I can keep small promises like that. You think so little of me! I'm upset.
Complete_String=(Gabriela Individual Quest) (7/10)<br>I couldn't even leave a scratch on Gabriela. It wasn't simply a difference of strength; it was the difference in levels of existence.

Occur_String3=The queen's guards weren't Shadow Phantoms. They were dark-skinned elves. <br>Are they related?
Occur_String4=Yes. They're a special unit called the Dark Shadows. <br>These days, the queen has chosen to have the Dark Shadows by her side<br>instead of the Shadow Phantoms.
Occur_String5=Now her personal army is larger than Noria's regular forces. <br>When I voiced my concern as princess, she confined me here.

Name=Attacked Farm
Occur_String1=I work at the Idrel Farm. The farm has been attacked by Goblins.
Occur_String2=Do Goblins still live around here?
Occur_String3=Yes, they stayed here after the Three-year War, without going back to Pandemonium. Like in Enova.<br>They had been quiet for a while, but attacked the farm during the chaos of the war.
Occur_String4=I just ran away. I tried to escape on one of the Reptila boats...<br>but none of them could sail. They had holes all over the bottom...<br>And the wound from the Goblin attack got worse, so...
Occur_String5=It's my punishment for abandoning the other farmers to die. I... am done. Please<br>save the farmers. The Goblins will kill them all otherwise.

Occur_String2=You mean that traitor?
Occur_String3=Don't talk if you don't know. He asked me to save you.<br>And... He must have died by now.
Occur_String4=I see... But I don't have time to hear why Gyunein died.<br>We are busy fighting the Goblins.
Occur_String5=Why are they after the farm?
Occur_String6=Slaughter and plunder. They want to kill us all and take all the fruits.

Occur_String3=Go five looths to the northeast from the farm, and you'll see the border post.<br>Once you get past that, it's Ashas territory...

Occur_String6=But if we can use the stone launchers that the Goblins destroyed, we will be able to protect our farm.<br>Could you please repair the stone launchers?
Doing_String=Gyunein... I hope he rests in peace...
Completable_String1=Welcome. %s_9_1. I got the message from Iris.<br>I'll help you cross the border.
Complete_String=I repaired the stone launchers for the farmers and arrived in the border post. Thankfully, Iris' message arrived first, so it should be easier to find the blue girl.

Occur_String2=A large unit of Dark Shadows went past here into Ashas territory.<br>In order to get revenge on the Ashas for attacking Breath of the World Tree.
Occur_String3=Our soldiers here at the post were filled with thoughts of revenge.<br>But after witnessing that the Dark Shadows massacre of Ashas civilians on the battlefield...<br>now we are really confused.
Occur_String4=We can see burning houses and piles of Ashas corpses from here.<br>What the Dark Shadows are doing... isn't right. This is wrong.
Occur_String5=... (The Dark Shadows who are backed by the queen...)<br>It seems they are inciting hatred rather than seeking revenge. But I have to find out the truth...
Occur_String6=I will cross the border now. Revenge only leads to more revenge.<br>The Ashas forces may attack this place soon. Be prepared.
Doing_String=[To his soldiers] You heard %s_9_1, right? We have no time to be emotional.<br>Get ready for the attack from the Ashas!

Name=Pride of Ashas
Occur_String1=Civilians are dying at the hands of the Dark Shadows. Why aren't you doing anything?!<br>You cowards, hiding in the fortress...
Occur_String2=Don't speak if you don't know anything. Protecting the priests comes first.<br>The troops at the fortress were sent to the Communion Shrine.
Occur_String3=Bull! Are you saying that the lives of priests are more important than the civilians'?
Occur_String4=Just calm down a little.<br>The Elves surpass us both in terms of their civilization and military power.<br>However, we were able to keep the country safe all these years thanks to our mind communion ability.
Occur_String5=When the priests carry out telepathic communication, all the Ashas can share all their senses.<br>In other words, they act as eyes and ears of the priests.
Occur_String6=Yes, I've heard about it.<br>So, is this Communion Shrine a place for communion rituals?
Occur_String7=Yes, it is. I... don't want to call it a sacrifice for the greater cause... but if the Communion Shrine falls, it's the end.<br>That's why... we had to make a choice. I don't expect you to understand, but I won't tolerate ill-informed slander, either.
Occur_String8=Then... since the Communion Shrine is safe, does that mean you can keep it up?
Occur_String9=(shaking his head)<br>We haven't heard from the Shrine for quite some time.<br>I want to go and see what happened... but we can't afford to divert our troops anymore.
Occur_String10=I will go. I cannot let them continue with the massacre.

Name=The one behind...
Occur_String1=Welcome, %s_9_1.
Occur_String2=Both sides are saying that the other started the war. So have you finally found a middle ground?
Occur_String3=This war was started by an anonymous informant.<br>That person told Pope King that the elves would charge the World Tree to eliminate the Ashas...
Occur_String4=And told Queen Cara that the Ashas would attack them so that she must charge the World Tree.
Occur_String5=And both sides haven't dispatched the regular army.<br>We are the Ashas Nakans, the Pope King's guards.
Occur_String6=And Noria also dispatched the dark elf special unit...
Occur_String7=The Dark Shadows have led the war. They are killing Ashas civilians here.
Occur_String8=So you are at war because of this anonymous source.<br>Who is it...
Occur_String9=We suspect the blue girl.<br>We think she might have started the war in order to steal the blue stone from the Sapientia Statue...

Completable_String1=I tracked her down to here. Have you found out anything about her whereabouts?

Occur_String2=They are from the outskirts of Noria. They kidnap people and sell them as slaves.<br>The problem is... Dark Shadows had the Elves fight for them.
Occur_String3=Just like the Ashas used the Brolls to invade the Breath of the World Tree.
Occur_String4=Yes. They are capturing Ashas villagers at the north of Wellspring Haven.<br>To sell them as slaves.

Occur_String3=The Dark Shadows, the dark elf special unit are the ones who brought the Dantarex into this.<br>And Iris wanted to take responsibility for their immorality.
Occur_String4=I see... But as long as the slave merchants have their boats, they will continue to capture Ashas villagers.
Occur_String5=Please. Burn down those slave boats.<br>There are archers who shoot fire arrows amongst the slave merchants. You should be able to burn them down with that fire.

Occur_String5=It is the tomb of Pabillune, the Ancient Ashas Sage.<br>If the Elves have Sapientia Temple, we have Pabillune's Tomb.
Occur_String6=And why do you think she went there?
Occur_String7=The tomb has a statue of Pabillune at the center, and it has a blue stone mounted on it.<br>Just as the Sapientia statue does.
Occur_String8=Dark Shadows are laying waste to the tomb as we speak.<br>They are taking revenge for the destruction of Sapientia Temple.

Occur_String10=We have to head to the Pioneer's Ruins right away. We have to catch up with her before it's too late.

Occur_String3=Noria is ruled by queens. And the crown princess is elected by the consensus of the nobility, scholars, and representatives.<br>Elves live long lives, you know. Humans only have to tolerate bad rulers for several decades at most, but we elves may have to endure for hundreds of years. It's awful just to think about it, isn't it?
Occur_String4=I always thought monarchs and their heirs are blood-related, but a different rule seems to apply in Noria.<br>Choosing the most qualified candidate to become the next ruler through consensus... It sounds reasonable. It's a good system.
Doing_String=We Elves always give the same as we received.
Completable_String1=I thought I would never see your face here. Do the Queen's orders mean nothing to you?
Completable_String2=I don't really mean to talk about the method. It only means Zakarian has been always like that.<br>Anyway, I now understand the situation. Take care, then.
Complete_String=Linda came all the way to Ethedrean to see me. Linda told me she found the journal of her grandfather, Cerberus. Reading the journal, she found a clue about Cerberus' necklace.
List_String=(Noria Main Quest) (3/48)<br>Queen Cara and Lunedill are not related by blood. Then, how did Lunedill become her successor? I'd better ask Lunedill about that.

[Quest_5456]
Name=The Sealed Necklace
Completable_String1=Now, the necklace... It seems to have been sealed. Yes, I remember trying to break its seal with Cerberus. The four sacred jewels. We found them, broke their seals, and hid them in the Rifts.
Complete_String=Queen Cara wandered all around the continent with Cerberus to break the necklace's seal. I have to talk to Linda for more details.
List_String=(Noria Main Quest) (45/48)<br>I should go back to the Holy Bunker and talk to Fratanne. How did Pabillune rise from the dead? Who's this blue-skinned girl? And what does she want? There are too many hidden truths.

Name=Urgent Message
Occur_String1=Qwyinan? From Chaisong?
Occur_String2=Yes. He didn't write much, probably to avoid losing face, but he wants to see you in Qwyinan Village as soon as possible.
Occur_String3=This is the first time the Line Alliance has sent us any messages. It really must need your help with something.
Occur_String4=The Dracans Knight Commander wouldn't have called me unless it was extremely important.<br>I guess I should go.
Occur_String5=Okay. Thank you for everything so far.<br>I'd like to thank you on behalf of the Noria Kingdom.
Doing_String=Come and see me sometimes.<br>You're now probably the only one I have who can tell me about the outside world.
Completable_String1=Brother! Long time, no see! How have you been?
Completable_String2=I've been through hell, thanks to someone I know in Noria.<br>But I'm still alive, so I guess I'm alright.
Completable_String3=Hah hah hah! Are you talking about the Noria Princess?
Completable_String4=Yes. She sure knows how to take advantage of people.<br>Ah, by the way, Chaisong. You were looking for me. What's going on?
Completable_String5=Well... As you may have assumed, Kainan's condition... <br>I couldn't take care of it on my own.
Complete_String=I dropped by Lunedill's place for the first time in a long while, and unexpectedly heard about Chaisong in Litenberg. According to Lunedill, this was the first time that the Dracans Knights, members of the Line Alliance, had ever sent a letter to the elves. Even though Chaisong didn't write much, she could tell he was looking for me in a hurry.<br>I went to Chaisong in Qwyinan Village in Litenberg, and as Lunedill expected, he seemed to have a very urgent matter at hand.

Occur_String1=What do you mean? You're the Dracans Knight Commander. If you can't take care of it, what makes you think I can?
Occur_String2=Did you forget what happened in Litenberg? <br>If it weren't for you, I would've died there.
Occur_String3=Well, fine. What is it this time?
Occur_String4=Kainan's loss to you freed him from his mental possession, but he had been possessed for so long that it broke his mind.
Occur_String5=Even the great Kundun shook his head in resignation.<br>But Council Chairman Quadro knew the solution.
Occur_String6=He said it could be found within the ancient knowledge that our ancestors left on the last stage of Dracansor, the sanctum of Dracans Knights.
Occur_String7=You may not know this, but Dracansor is where we Dracanses are tested for our worthiness to join the Dracans Knights, but so far, no one has passed the last stage.
Occur_String8=So, you need my help to pass the last stage. Is that it?
Occur_String9=Yes.<br>Between you and me, I'm sure we can do it!
Occur_String10=Well, alright. I'm sure that if I help you, it'll be worth it.
Doing_String=There's a place we should go: the Foreigner Residence. There, we have to ask Quadro's permission for something.
Completable_String1=Stranger. I didn't think we'd meet again. What a surprise!
Complete_String=Chaisong has found a way to fix Kainan's broken mind, but he'll need my help. Dracansor, the holy ground of the Dracans Knights. I have a feeling this journey is going to be dangerous.

Name=Deep-rooted Hatred
Occur_String1=Dracans Knight Commander Chaisong came to see you, Chairman. Please allow this warrior to challenge the Realm of Perseverance with me.
Occur_String2=Chaisong! You and that warrior cooperated with those scumbags of Lorencia who devastated our land! Did you think I didn't know that!?
Occur_String3=Chairman, that man, Adrian of the Nobility Alliance, was responsible for what happened back then. He colluded with the Demons. If it weren't for the Deviases and this warrior, we would've been wiped off the face of the earth.
Occur_String4=Deviases, Nobility Allianceâ€”same difference! What happened back then has confirmed my belief that anyone from Lorencia can't be trusted! So, stop trying to fool me with your smooth talk, Chaisong!
Occur_String5=...Okay, but I know for a fact that we can't pass all the tests in the Realm of Perseverance without this warrior's help. I can't force you to allow it, but I'll make sure you're held accountable for the consequences of your decision.
Occur_String6=Are you threatening me now, Chaisong?
Occur_String7=I'm not. I just want my deputy, Kainan, to return to work. Please reconsider your decision.
Occur_String8=...This had better lead to something good, or else!<br>Is that understood?
Occur_String9=Yes. If I fail this task, I'll step down from my position as the Knight Commander.
Occur_String10=You'd better!
Doing_String=I don't want to see you again. Get the hell out of here, stranger!
Completable_String1=You're crazy, risking your position for this.
Complete_String=I met Dracans Elder Council Chairman Quadro again, and his hatred toward Lorencia was greater than ever. Chaisong had to risk his position as the Knight Commander to convince him to approve of me. I'm still not sure if that was really necessary.

Doing_String=It wouldn't do any good for you to stay here.
Completable_String1=Halt! This place is off limits.
Complete_String=Following Chaisong's instructions, I went to Gonchi in Qwyinan Village. Just as I expected, he blocked my way and said the place before me was off limits.

Occur_String3=I'll keep that in mind.
Occur_String4=Good. And when you enter Dracansor, you should drop by the Dracans Knights' Command Center and see the Master Knight first. As a stranger, you'll need his approval to enter the Realm of Perseverance.
Doing_String=All Dracanses thank you for your heroism.
Completable_String1=Hah hah hah! You're that famous Strange Slaughterer, aren't you? <br>Chaisong can't stop praising your deeds. Welcome to Dracansor!

Name=Master Knight
Occur_String1=I guess I wasn't far behind you. Yakan, my brother. This is the new brother I've told you about. Please treat him as you would me.
Occur_String2=Hah hah hah! Who knew the great Chaisong would ever say something like that? Alright, good! As of today, I've got one more brother. Hey, Chaisong! Ready to drink all night?
Occur_String3=Always... But I can't right now. Our brother and I have to enter the Realm of Perseverance. <br>As you might have heard, Vice Captain Kainan is not in good condition. We're hoping to find a solution in the Chamber of Wisdom beyond the Realm of Perseverance.
Occur_String4=The Chamber of Wisdom? That's suicidal! Why don't you take me with you instead? With our experience, it might just be possible.
Occur_String5=I appreciate your offer, but no. If both of us die, who's going to take care of the others? This is for the best, Brother.
Occur_String6=Hah hah hah! I suppose you're right. I understand. Hey, new brother. Here's your permit. Good luck to both of you. You'll need it.

Complete_String=Chaisong arrived at the Dracans Knights' Command Center not long after I did. He introduced me to Master Knight Yakan and asked him to treat me as he would treat him. The Master Knight heartily accepted Chaisong's request and gave me a permit to enter the Realm of Perseverance.

Occur_String2=Ch-Chaisong... I-I came here... b-because I have a favor to ask...
Occur_String3=Your Highness, I'm your subject. You don't even have to ask. Please tell me what you want. Your wish is my command.
Occur_String4=Hah hah hah! Today, I'm seeing many interesting facets of your personality, Chaisong! I've never seen you so disconcerted before, either! Hey, Chaisong. His Highness would like to enter the Realm of Perseverance with you.
Occur_String5=What? But why...!?
Occur_String6=Listen. In case you don't know, His Highness has been banished from the Royal Family. You know what kind of man His Majesty is. Things were good until the former Crown Prince, Woongpam, was disowned by his Family for the disgrace he brought upon it.
Occur_String7=His Majesty thinks highly of warriors. He doesn't make exceptions for anyone, even his own children. In fact, he's sterner to them because they have to carry on his legacy. He wants to see if Prince Bryant has what it takes to be his heir.
Occur_String8=In other words, he's declared that he will not let Prince Bryant back in the palace unless he passes the Realm of Perseverance: Worthiness. When he first came here, I tried to pair him with another instructor and even myself. He insisted that it had to be you, Chaisong.
Occur_String9=...I see, Your Highness. It's my honor to escort you to the Realm of Perseverance. Your Highness, please get ready to leave.
Occur_String10=I'm sorry, Brother. It turned out you and I will have to move separately in the Realm of Perseverance: Worthiness. Here, take this permit from Yakan to the Gates of Glory. The instructor there will tell you what to do.
Doing_String=I'm sorry that things turned out this way, Brother. But this was a complete surprise to me, too.
Completable_String1=Halt! Only Dracanses are allowed to enter this sacred testing ground.
Complete_String=The plan to journey with Chaisong was thrown out the window the moment Prince Bryant showed up. Now Chaisong had to accompany this Prince, and I'm left on my own. Can I really explore this unfamiliar place, Realm of Perseverance, by myself?

Occur_String1=Here's my permit from the Master Knight. Your commander Chaisong said you'd tell me what to do if I give this to you. Correct?
Occur_String2=Mm... Judging by the message, you really were sent by Commander Chaisong. Alright, since this must be your first time here, let me give you a simple introduction.
Occur_String3=The Realm of Perseverance is a gigantic gorge that was discovered during the age of the ancient Wallkreiger Empire. It's extremely dangerous, infested with monsters from a massive Rift that formed eons ago.
Occur_String4=But we Dracanses, being the warrior race that we are, have long been using it as a training ground to transform our youngsters into excellent combatants as soon as they come of age. The most talented of them all are also selected to become Dracans Knights.
Occur_String5=That's enough explanation. Basically, you're saying this is a training ground for you, right? Then, where's the first training area?
Occur_String6=The Realm of Perseverance is so vast that it's difficult to verbally describe where everything is. So, we're giving everyone who enters here a map that the Dracans Knights created. It shows the location of each testing area. You can use it to navigate this place.
Doing_String=These Gates of Glory are a symbolic structure built to celebrate the victory of the allied forces that conquered this place. They look magnificent, don't they?

Occur_String2=The supply crew should be here soon. I'll ask them to spread the word to the other bases. Speaking of which, they haven't been coming as frequently as they used to. We're okay for now because we're close to HQ, but the other bases aren't as lucky as we are.
Occur_String3=Let them deal with it. Tell me about the test first.
Occur_String4=Oh, right. You came at the right time. You must have seen that most of our barricades are broken on your way here. <br>Fix them first, will you?
Occur_String5=Why can't you do that yourselves?<br>Such chores can't be part of the test.
Occur_String6=Hah hah hah! If you're going to give me that attitude, you'd better go back. We select Dracans Knights through the Realm of Perseverance, and to do that, soldiers must obey our orders.
Occur_String7=Being an outsider, you may not have to know all that, but since you're here, you should do as we Dracanses do. Wouldn't you agree?
Occur_String8=...I see. I apologize for what I just said. I was a soldier once. I agree with you.
Occur_String9=Good. Now that we understand each other, let's get to work, shall we?<br>Thank you in advance.

[Quest_5621]
Name=Second Testing Area
Occur_String1=Are you the instructor of this Area?<br>I was just doing what I was asked at the First Area.
Occur_String2=What did they ask?<br>Normally, the applicants come over here with the supply crew.
Occur_String3=The instructor there was suspicious of the Chakuas, so he asked me to go check on them. However, I couldn't do that properly because there was only one way into their base. So, I just barged right through it and checked what they were doing.
Occur_String4=...Geez! You should've returned to the base and requested reinforcements, or asked for a different mission. At least that's what sane people do! ...Anyway, did you find anything there?
Occur_String5=They had dozens of fully functioning siege towers and stone launchers at their base. I couldn't destroy them all, so I just took care of those I saw on my way. I doubt the rest would be a problem, even if they're left alone.
Occur_String6=My goodness, who knew the Chakuas were capable of creating siege machines?<br>How did they do it?
Occur_String7=Their chief said their schematics were among the loot that they got when they attacked the First Training Area.
Occur_String8=What the...? What were the guys in the First Area thinking? I can't believe they left such dangerous materials where anyone could get them!
Occur_String9=Gah! That really irritates me! Well, anyway, good job. I'll reward you for completing your first mission.
Doing_String=You'll get the same type of reward from each Training Area. <br>Its quantity, however, varies, depending on the difficulty level of your mission.
Completable_String1=This Token is a sort of certificate awarded to the trainees by us instructors for completing their test at each Area. Keep them safe, and you can exchange them for good equipment through the Exchanger in the Temple later.
Complete_String=The instructor of the Second Testing Area was a female Dracans Knight. I reported to her about my mission from the First Area. She was shocked to learn that the Chakuas had created siege machines.

[Quest_5622]
Name=Herb Gathering
Occur_String1=So, you know Chaisong sent me. The supply crew must have been here recently.<br>The instructor in the First Area said supplies haven't been coming very frequently. Was he exaggerating?
Occur_String2=No. It really has been infrequent, and if this continues, all the bases here will be wiped out sooner or later.
Occur_String3=We've been asking for reinforcements that never come, and the new supplies that we've just got are barely enough to go around.
Occur_String4=...There has to be a reason. By the way, what kinds of tests do you have here?
Occur_String5=Ah, the tests! Yes, I could use some help. See the wounded soldiers over there? For now, I'd like you to get some herbs for them. It could be dangerous because of the thrashers that poured out of the nearby Rift, but you're strong enough to take care of them, right?
Doing_String=I wish the other trainees could be as skilled as you...
Completable_String1=Good job! Now, let's talk about your next mission, shall we?
Complete_String=According to the second instructor, Anan, the Dracans Knights have lost their original base to the Demons that came out of the Rift, and the current defense line was formed by some of the surviving soldiers. But even this temporary base could fall anytime, what with the increasingly infrequent supply from HQ.

[Quest_5623]
Name=Stabilize the Rift
Occur_String1=Mm... Before we talk about my next mission, let me be honest with you. I think there are some serious problems here in the Realm of Perseverance. The supply crew doesn't come often, the siege machine schematics were stolen from the First Area... I don't know what your HQ is thinking.
Occur_String2=I couldn't agree with you more. Speaking of which, you're close to the Commander, right? Can't you talk to him on our behalf?
Occur_String3=I thought the Master Knight was in charge of the Realm of Perseverance. From what I heard from Chaisong, he seems to trust the Master Knight's management of this place.
Occur_String4=But that's the thing. We tried to talk to the Master Knight many times, but he wouldn't listen to us. It's time Commander Chaisong knows what's really going on here.
Occur_String5=As far as I know, Chaisong has entered this gorge with one of your princes, who doesn't seem to know how to fight. Chaisong has his work cut out for him.
Occur_String6=What? Commander Chaisong is coming this way?<br>Oh, no! He can't see us in this state!
Occur_String7=Hey, hey! Calm down for now, and tell me about my next mission.
Occur_String8=Oh, right! Your mission is to stabilize the Rift that opened over there. At any other time, we only send out our trainees after increasing the power of the stabilizers in the base, but we can't do that right now. Say, are you up for it?
Occur_String9=The stabilizers? Are they used to weaken monsters on the other side of the Rift?
Occur_String10=Well, I don't know exactly how they work, but I think what you said is close enough. They were developed by an old ally of ours, the Ashases, so I don't know all the details.
Doing_String=If you're not confident you can do this, you can just give up. I don't need more corpses on my conscience.
Completable_String1=Wow, good job! To be honest, I thought it'd be a difficult task for a single person, even if it was Commander Chaisong.
Complete_String=I gave Anan my honest opinion about the Realm of Perseverance. Anan completely agreed with me and asked me to talk to her commander, Chaisong, on her behalf.

[Quest_5624]
Name=To the Dracans Knights' Base
Occur_String1=Was this the last mission for me in this Area?
Occur_String2=Correct. Good job. Mm... And this is something I'd like to ask you on the side... but could you go pick up something in the Dracans Knights' base over there?
Occur_String3=...Alright, but I want you to tell me the details about how you lost a base to the enemy. I've developed a personal interest in what's happening in this place.
Occur_String4=Absolutely! And this is the first I'm telling anyone this, but something suspicious happened at that time.
Occur_String5=It must have happened early in the morning that day. One of the guards on the graveyard shift discovered our Rift stabilizers were broken, so he reported it to his superiors. They said they'd have the supply crew coming the next day report it to HQ, and left the stabilizers as they were.
Occur_String6=Not long after that, an army of monsters stormed our base, killing and injuring most of our members. Only a handful of people who were on call or on the graveyard shift the night before were able to evacuate to this place and save themselves.
Occur_String7=The stabilizers were broken... Did the guard who reported that mention any traces of the perpetrator in his report?
Occur_String8=Well, I don't know. I was one of the people on call that day. But perhaps some records might be left in the command center. Actually, they're what I want you to pick up from the base.
Occur_String9=And if you find them, you don't have to come back here. Instead, you can take them to the defense base on the other side. It's your next testing area, anyway.
Doing_String=If you see Commander Chaisong, please don't forget to talk to him on our behalf.
Completable_String1=Has help finally arrived!? Wait, but you're not one of us Dracanses.
Complete_String=According to Anan, someone purposefully damaged the Rift stabilizers in her base, leaving it vulnerable to the Demons. And it seems she wants to tell Chaisong directly, instead of reporting to the Dracans Knights' Command Center.
List_String=(Dracansor Main Quest) (25/44)<br>Move to the Dracans Knights' base to collect the incident report.

[Quest_5625]
Name=Situation that Night
Occur_String1=I'm sorry, but as you can see, I'm here on my own. I can't help you.
Occur_String2=I see. Why doesn't HQ do anything to help us?
Occur_String3=Mm... Hey, I don't have much time, either, so let's make this short. Anan asked me to pick up a incident report in your command center. Do you know anything about that place?
Occur_String4=...I think I know what incident report you're talking about. I'm the one who wrote it. My superiors ignored my report, like the bunch of idiots that they were, and they all died before sunrise.
Occur_String5=Good, that makes things easy. Anan said someone broke the stabilizers in your base, and you discovered and reported about it. Do you know who might have done it?
Occur_String6=...You're an outsider. I'm not going to tell you.
Occur_String7=Well, alright. You may not know who I am, but I'm here to join your commander, Chaisong. If you have something to tell him, I can relay it to him. Or you can keep waiting for reinforcements that will never come.
Occur_String8=Hmpf, alright. One of the guards on the previous shift that day said that some high-ranking officer from HQ paid an unexpected visit and went to where the stabilizers were.
Occur_String9=Okay, then we should find out who that officer was. Next, your report. Are there any documents related to it left in your command center?
Occur_String10=I reported it verbally, but I saw an operator at the command center transcribe it. The transcription must still be in the command center, unless something happened to it.
Doing_String=If you really see Commander Chaisong, please tell him about our situation.
Completable_String1=Brother, good to see you again!
Complete_String=The wounded soldier who was hiding in a corner by the entrance told me what happened when his base was invaded by thrashers. I think the key to this case is the identity of the high-ranking officer who visited the base during the mid shift.

Occur_String2=...Alright, tell me.
Occur_String3=On your way to the command center, you'll see our arsenal. I want you to collect the weapons in there, so the thrashers can't use them.
Doing_String=I'm not going to let them use our own weapons against us.
Complete_String=The wounded Dracans soldier didn't want the thrashers to use their weapons. I collected all the weapons on the weapon rack for him.

Name=Checking the Enemy's Movement
Occur_String1=Good to see you, Chaisong! How's His Highness?
Occur_String2=Safe so far, thanks to Bulcan. By the way, Brother, I've heard the base near the entrance is occupied by Demons. How did you get through there alive?
Occur_String3=I had no choice, an instructor named Anan asked me to find something there.<br>Ah, speaking of which, you should see this first.
Occur_String4=This... What is it about, Brother?
Occur_String5=It's about an incident that took place before the base was invaded by the enemy. According to the soldier who reported it to his superiors, he discovered that someone broke their Rift stabilizers a few hours before the thrashers came. His superiors didn't take it seriously and put off the repairs.
Occur_String6=There are such lazy people among us Dracans Knights.<br>Unbelievable!
Occur_String7=That's not all. If you read that report, you'll see a higher-ranking officer visited for an inspection and went to where the stabilizers were before the night shift. Then, mysteriously, they were found to be damaged.
Occur_String8=...Oh, no! Are you suggesting a member of the Dracans Knights' Command Center was behind this?
Occur_String9=It's too early to say, but the identity of that high-ranking officer is definitely the key to this case.
Occur_String10=...Thank you, Brother. But for now, there's a more pressing matter at hand. According to our scouts, the Blood Teeth stationed north of this base are making suspicious movements. I'm sorry, but I'd like you to go check on them.
Doing_String=We were fighting the Blood Teeth for a long time before you arrived.
Completable_String1=Good day. I'm BOrikh, the adjutant to Commander Chaisong. I'm sorry, but currently, the Commander and His Highness are having an important conversation. I can't let you in. If you leave your message with me, I'll deliver it to him later.
Complete_String=I told Chaisong what happened in the fallen Dracans Knights' base, and he was so flabbergasted that he could hardly believe it. I showed him the report about the incident that night, and he accepted the truth at last.

[Quest_5629]
Name=The Demons that Threaten the Base
Occur_String1=Things are worse than I thought. The Blood Teeth have been driven your way by the Kunikuluses. They're gathered around the entrance, gearing up to attack this place. To them, it's the only exit.
Occur_String2=This is bad. We're surrounded by enemies, and most of us are too injured to fight.<br>Will HQ ever send us help?
Occur_String3=I doubt it. I came through a couple of other defense bases on my way, and none of them were getting much support from HQ, either.
Occur_String4=The commander has to be thinking about this. He probably just hasn't stepped in yet because the Realm of Perseverance is the Master Knight's jurisdiction.
Occur_String5=That's good to know. Was this the last mission for me in this Area?
Occur_String6=I'm sorry, but Commander Chaisong would like you to take care of one more mission. He's asked us soldiers to defend this base and for you to eliminate the enemy outside it.
Occur_String7=He has to be with your prince, so I guess I'll just have to handle this.<br>Alright, what do you want me to do exactly?
Occur_String8=What's more problematic than the Blood Teeth is the Kunikuluses that have been pouring out of the nearby Rift. So, sir knight, please storm their stronghold on the other side of the Rift and wreak some havoc.
Occur_String9=I'll destroy it so thoroughly that they won't dare come out of there for a while.
Doing_String=Please be careful. We don't know what kind of danger lies in wait over there.
Completable_String1=The number of Kunikuluses approaching our base has noticeably decreased, and I have a feeling it has to do with you, sir knight.

Occur_String1=Good. Now it's the Blood Teeth, isn't it?
Occur_String2=That's right. But before you go, I've got something to tell you.
Occur_String3=What is it?
Occur_String4=The Blood Teeth and the Kunikuluses are at each other's throats at the moment. Cripple one of them too much, and you'll tip the scale in favor of the other camp.
Occur_String5=Gotcha. You want me to damage the Blood Teeth enough to give them a warning, but not enough to weaken them so much that they can't keep the Kunikuluses in check anymore.
Occur_String6=You're pretty shrewd. <br>Then, I'll be counting on you.
Doing_String=I hope you'll maintain balance between the Demons from the Rift and the local tribes. <br>It's the most important function of the Realm of Perseverance.
Completable_String1=Welcome back! Thanks to you, this base will be safe for a while. Commander Chaisong has personally prepared a reward for you for your heroic feats in this Area, sir knight.
Complete_String=After I took care of the thrashers and quelled the imminent danger, BOrikh asked me to damage the Blood Teeth without tipping the scale in favor of the Kunikuluses. To maintain balance between the Demons from the Rift and the local tribes is the most important function of the Realm of Perseverance.

Occur_String1=By the way, sir knight, I believe it's time for you to move on to the next Area.
Occur_String2=Mm... Will you be okay without me?
Occur_String3=Not exactly, but I think we can manage until the next visit from the supply crew. Commander Chaisong said that he's sorry that he can't see you off in person, and asked you for one last personal favor.
Occur_String4=Alright, what is it?
Occur_String5=As things stand, it's only a matter of time before the Blood Teeth lose all their territory to the Kunikuluses. Commander Chaisong would like you to clear another Rift where the Kunikuluses have been coming out.
Occur_String6=And since it's near your next Testing Area, he'd also like you to get rid of the Kunikuluses you see on your way there.
Occur_String7=I'll think about it. Tell Chaisong that I really want to see him in the next Area.
Doing_String=I'll make sure the Commander receives your message.<br>Then, travel safely to the next Area.
Complete_String=Chaisong's adjutant said that my test in the current Area was done and that I should move to the next Area. He also asked me on Chaisong's behalf to cull the Kunikuluses on my way there, to prevent them from completely destroying the Blood Teeth.

I was fighting my way through throngs of Kunikuluses to get to the Rift when I noticed the broken, somewhat artificial-looking barricades in the midst of the demolished structures.
Completable_String1=Halt! You're not one of us. How did you get in here?

Name=Last Testing Area
Occur_String1=I'm here on behalf of your commander, Chaisong. I've got a permit from your Master Knight, too. I'll show it to you if you want.
Occur_String2=Mm... I can tell the Master Knight wrote this permit himself. Alright, then let me ask you one more thing: you're not one of us, so what did Commander Chaisong ask you to do here?
Occur_String3=He's looking for something only found in the last phase of this place that can help repair his deputy's broken mind. But he needed help, so he asked me to come here with him.
Occur_String4=You're lying! Commander Chaisong is more than strong enough to complete the last phase without help. There's no reason for him to enter this first phase, Worthiness, with you.
Occur_String5=Let me finish. Chaisong is here with your prince at his request. And the prince is here to prove his qualifications to eventually become emperor. Did you know about that?
Occur_String6=Mm... You know about His Highness, too. You really must have been sent by the commander.<br>Alright, I apologize for my rudeness.
Occur_String7=No need. You were just doing your job, inspecting guests as a guard. By the way, this place looks the worst among all the Testing Areas I've been to. Is it because of monsters from the Rift?
Occur_String8=You don't know what you're talking about. This place is better than our other base nearby, which was completely destroyed by gremlins. Most of the wounded soldiers we have here escaped from gremlins there.
Occur_String9=So, this is actually the last Testing Area. <br>Alright, what can I do to help?
Occur_String10=If it's not too much trouble, I'd like you to take care of the Demons around here. As you can see, most of us are wounded and can hardly fight.
Doing_String=I know it's not easy, but if Commander Chaisong relies on you, then you're well capable.
Completable_String1=There's a reason Commander Chaisong seems to depend on you. Thank you. That's a load off my chest.
Complete_String=I defeated the Kunikuluses and arrived at the last Testing Area. It was in shambles. Most of its barricades were broken, and half of its soldiers were gravely injured, moaning in pain. I wiped out the Demons around the base at its instructor's request, and he thanked me for my help.

Occur_String1=By the looks of it, your base must have been completely cut off from supplies.<br>Have you tried to contact HQ?
Occur_String2=We usually go to the Dracans Knights' base nearby to contact HQ, but now that it's completely occupied by the Demons, we have no means of contacting it at the moment.
Occur_String3=Did you try to send a messenger there?<br>You know you can't last long in this state, right?
Occur_String4=Don't you think I know that? I just couldn't do anything because of the situation we were in. You look strong. Perhaps you could be our messenger as the last objective of your test.
Occur_String5=...Sure. Then, what's my next mission?
Occur_String6=To be able to report to HQ on our behalf, you have to know our damage situation. For your next mission, I'd like you to assess the situation in the base up north. Are you up for it?
Occur_String7=I guess I can do that... for now.
Doing_String=According to the soldiers from that base, their Rift stabilizers malfunctioned before the gremlins invaded them.
Completable_String1=...Wh-what the...!? You're not a Dracans.<br>Are you an outsourced mercenary?
Complete_String=Pelu, the instructor in the last Testing Area, said he couldn't contact his headquarters anymore because the Dracans Knights' base nearby was occupied by the invading Demons, gremlins.

Occur_String2=What? Commander Chaisong did? Oh, thank Bulcan! You're here to save us!<br>Finally, my prayers have been answered!
Occur_String3=Wait. I'm a mercenary hired by Chaisong, but he never asked me to help evacuate all of you. I came here alone. It's physically impossible for me to do that.
Occur_String4=...If you're not here to save us, then why are you here?
Occur_String5=I've been sent to assess your situation and report back to your HQ. So, I suggest you cooperate with me. The faster I get to your HQ, the higher your chance of survival.
Occur_String6=Oh... Okay. Then, ask me anything. I'll answer you to the best of my ability.
Occur_String7=Let's start with how the Demons invaded you.
Occur_String8=Sorry, but I was off duty that day. I don't know exactly how they did it. But in the middle of the chaos, I overheard others saying that the Rift stabilizers suddenly turned off minutes before the gremlins jumped out of the nearby Rift by the hundreds.
Occur_String9=(I'd better find out what turned off the stabilizers.) <br>Thank you for the information. Hang on until help arrives.
Doing_String=Aww... Rescue party be damned! Is it even coming?
Completable_String1=Wah! You startled me! Haven't you left for HQ yet?
Complete_String=The remaining soldier in the Dracans Knights' base told me how his base was occupied by the gremlins. I went to where the Rift stabilizers were and examined them. All of them had some strange runes engraved on them. I used a sharp metal piece to scratch off the runes. The stabilizers turned back on, emitting a light.

Occur_String2=I knew it. But who? <br>No one in this base could have done it unless they went out of their minds.
Occur_String3=Your colleagues couldn't have done it. There were ancient runes... Not many people on this continent know them. Do you know anyone among your kind who might?
Occur_String4=Only a handful of members of my kind would have such esoteric knowledge. The highest-ranking members of the Dracans Knights; I'm saying at least vice-captain, for example.
Occur_String5=You mean there are only a few who are capable of deciphering such a language?<br>Got it. And where's your central base?
Occur_String6=Take the road on my right side and go south. You're not going to go there alone, are you? It'd be like walking through hell right now!
Occur_String7=Mm... I'm thinking about it.
Occur_String8=And... This is just from me, but if you're heading for the beacon mound, could you break the cannons along the way, so the enemy can't use them? I don't want Dracansor to be attacked by our own weapons, and I'm sure my dead comrades wouldn't, either.
Occur_String9=...Sure. Then, stay alive until we meet again.
Doing_String=Please don't forget to report our situation to HQ! I don't want to die here!

Occur_String3=Don't try to change the subject. I'm going to say what I have to say. It's your call to listen or not.
Occur_String4=Hah hah! You're more brusque than I thought. <br>Alright, what do you have to say?
Occur_String5=All the defense bases in the Realm of Perseverance have been losing support from headquarters. Some of them are already completely cut off. You're not going to say you didn't know, are you?
Occur_String6=Of course not. I've been thinking about that.
Occur_String7=...Alright, then one more thing: two of your bases have been occupied by the Demons. I investigated them and discovered signs of foul play by someone on the inside. Do you have anything to say about that?
Occur_String8=Hah hah hah! You're funny. Brother, I don't know what gave you the idea that I might do something so ludicrous, but fortunately, I've got many brothers who can vouch for me. For starters, why don't you talk to Zeren out by the Gates of Glory?
Occur_String9=...Sure, I'll do that. By the way, Chaisong and your prince are stuck in the Third Testing Area with no support whatsoever. Are you also aware of that?
Occur_String10=Of course, Brother. I'm in the process of forming a large-scale supply unit. If you don't mind, I'm going to contact Chaisong and make sure he moves on to the next phase right away.
Doing_String=Doubt begets misunderstanding. But I'm confident that I can clarify whatever doubts you have about me.
Completable_String1=Say, got any more questions for me?
Completable_String2=No. I'm done. I think I misunderstood you, and I'm sorry about that. And please contact Chaisong and help him come meet me in the next phase.
Completable_String3=Got it. You've got some time before you have to move on to the next phase. Why don't you get some rest?
Complete_String=The Master Knight had an answer for all my questions, which threw me off. Did I really misunderstand him? I can't help but think I'm missing something.

Occur_String1=If you're asking if I'm done taking tests at Worthiness over there, yes. Your master knight said I should get some rest before I move on to the next phase.
Occur_String2=Mm... You don't know how to get to the next phase, do you? Have you seen where Bulcan's Disciples are gathered in our outpost?
Occur_String3=I think I have, a few times. I'm not interested in religion, so I didn't talk to them, though.
Occur_String4=The next phase, Trials, is only accessible through the Rift where they are. One thing to note: because this Rift is created by the priests' holy power, it can disappear anytime.
Occur_String5=An unstable Rift, huh? That sounds peculiar.<br>Thank you for that information, but that's not why I came.
Occur_String6=Sorry, I should've asked first.<br>So, what is it?
Occur_String7=It's not something important. I just want to know if your Master Knight has entered the Realm of Perseverance recently.
Occur_String8=Mm... Not as far as I know. He used to visit the defense bases to encourage the members there, but that was a long time ago.
Occur_String9=...Thank you for telling me. Then, keep up the good work.
Doing_String=Feel free to come back if you have more questions.
Completable_String1=Finally, here we are. Good to see you again, Brother!
Complete_String=I asked Instructor Zeren at the Gates of Glory if he'd seen Yakan enter the Realm of Perseverance. He shook his head and said no. Yakan used to visit the bases sometimes to encourage the members there, but that was a long time ago.

Name=Qualifications to Join the Dracans Knights
Occur_String1=Did your prince return safely? It must have been tough, accompanying him.
Occur_String2=Yakan sent a supply unit, so he returned with it. And brother, Yakan said you did many great things for us Dracans Knights. Thank you.
Occur_String3=You're welcome. By the way, is this the last gateway? <br>To me, it just looks like an ancient site.
Occur_String4=...I'm sorry, Brother, but Trials isn't the last gateway for us. It is for new Dracans Knights, but what we're looking for is in the next phase.
Occur_String5=This is a temple built during the ancient Wallkreiger Kingdom to worship Bulcan. Death Roar, a dragon conceived by the Creator Akneria, took offense at its existence, so the angry beast magically dug up the entire temple and sealed it inside subspace.
Occur_String6=It must have grown weak lately, because this subspace has been revealed, swarming with its lackey monsters. You'll see it soon. There's even a guardian that looks like a two-headed dragon.
Occur_String7=All the Dracans warriors who reach this place receive one common mission: defeat the lackeys of Death Roar inside the temple. And be warned: in this place, one can attack anyone, friend or foe, and even one's own kind.
Occur_String8=In the past, priests of Bulcan physically struggled to train and push their bodies to their limits, and their targets of struggle were one another. That means, when you're here, Brother, you'll have to fight for yourself.
Occur_String9=I get your point. By the way, Chaisong, according to you, this is where Dracans Knights are selected. Does that mean you already passed it?
Occur_String10=That's right. And in the same sense, you don't have to pass this phase. When you're with me, the commander of the Dracans Knights, you don't have to prove yourself like other Dracans do to join us!
Doing_String=Say, Brother. How'd you like to join us Dracans Knights?
Completable_String1=Say, Brother. How'd you like to join us Dracans Knights?
Complete_String=According to Chaisong, Worthiness and Trials are for selecting Dracans Knights. Since he's already a Knight, Chaisong doesn't have to take the tests. I wasn't given such details when I first came here at his request. I can't believe I ran around taking the Dracans Knights tests that I didn't have to, to earn the right to try the last phase.

Occur_String2=Currently, we high-ranking combat priests are here to fight Death Roar's lackeys and reclaim our temple. Some of us also give missions to the trainees of Dracansor along with adequate rewards, if they complete them.
Occur_String3=These missions offer a generous number of Tokens. Depending on your effort, you can get enough Tokens to exchange for ancient armament of our kind through the Exchanger.
Occur_String4=I'll mark the location of each instructor on your map. Why don't you perform their missions while hunting Death Roar's lackeys?
Occur_String5=That's good to know.<br>Sure, I'll think about it.
Doing_String=Thank you. You're good enough to impress Commander Chaisong. I'm sure you'll be of great help to us.

Name=To the Last Level of Proof
Occur_String1=Hah, are you going to treat me like one of your men now, Chaisong?
Occur_String2=I'm just saying, Brother. But of all Dracanses, only we Dracans Knights are allowed to try this last phase, Proof, because of a dragon named Death Roar. It has lived here a long time and is too powerful for any other soldiers to take on.
Occur_String3=Then... you've been making me work thus far because you wanted to make sure I wouldn't get eaten alive by this dragon. Is that right?
Occur_String4=...In a way, yes. Truth be told, after you left for Dracansor, I told Quadro multiple times that you didn't have to take the test. The Elder was adamant that it was the rule.
Occur_String5=I can't believe you. I came to help you, and you put me to the test because you couldn't trust me. Chaisong, does that make sense to you?
Occur_String6=I don't know what to say. I'm sorry, Brother.
Occur_String7=And this is the first time I'm hearing about this dragon in the last phase.<br>Mm... This explains why Yakan said it was suicidal for us to come in here.
Occur_String8=Yakan overestimates his power; he's nowhere near as strong as he was before. I'm the living proof.
Occur_String9=You're lucky you're such a smooth talker. Ah... Okay, I got it. <br>Then, how do I get to this last phase?
Occur_String10=You can only enter the last phase through the entrance in the first phase, Worthiness. But before you go, there are some things have you do, and only Quadro can tell you what they are. He must have arrived at the command center by now. Let's go see him.
Doing_String=I should've given you enough details beforehand. Once again, I'm sorry, Brother.
Completable_String1=I've heard what you've done here.<br>I was wrong about you.
Complete_String=According to Chaisong, everything I did in the Realm of Perseverance was some sort of verification phase to see if I was strong enough to survive the dragon, Death Roar, in the last phase, Proof.

Name=(T) Advance Preparation
Occur_String1=I came here to help, and you guys had lots of errands for me. <br>Now, am I good enough to enter the last phase?
Occur_String2=...Yes. But you're mistaken about something here. We enforce such strict qualifications for the Proof stage to minimize unnecessary casualties at a national level.
Occur_String3=Ah, Chaisong told me that already. And... he also said that I need to do some things before I get there. What should I do?
Occur_String4=The entrance to the Proof phase is protected by several powerful layers to keep Death Roar in. That means no one can get in there either, by ordinary means.
Occur_String5=But the Evil Energy that the Demons carry in them can open a crack in even the thickest barrier, creating a sort of portable Evil Energy Tunnel.
Occur_String6=Mm... Let's skip the technical part. So, what do I have to do?
Occur_String7=Take this Evil Energy collector, enter the Rift, and get rid of the Demons on the other side. Energy from a single tribe isn't enough to fill the collector. You'll have to explore several Rifts.
Occur_String8=Okay, but does it have to be the Demons on the other side of the Rift?
Occur_String9=I don't know why, but the Demons lose most of their Evil Energy when they come out of the Rift. In other words, the Demons outside the Rift are useless for you.
Doing_String=You may not know this, but dimensions are separated by a powerful barrier that keeps otherworldly creatures out. For some reason, the Evil Energy can penetrate this barrier, though partially. And we want to use that.
Completable_String1=Err? You're that weird trainee from before! What are you doing here?
Complete_String=(Dracansor Talisman Quest) (1/13)<br>To enter the last phase, Proof, I needed a device to penetrate the powerful barriers around the entrance. Quadro, whom I met in the Dracans Knights' Command Center, told me I could use the Evil Energy from the Demons in the Rift to create a sort of portable Evil Energy Tunnel through even the thickest barrier. Now I should enter the Rift in the Realm of Perseverance and fight Demons until my Evil Energy collector is full.

Occur_String2=Are you kidding me? Do you know how many trainees pass here by every day?
Occur_String3=No. By the way, hasn't the supply unit arrived here yet?<br>Yakan said he's formed a large-scale supply unit.
Occur_String4=Not yet. But that's the happiest news I've heard lately.
Occur_String5=Strange. It's already been a while since it went by the defense base where Chaisong and your prince were.
Occur_String6=That place must have had a higher priority, since His Highness was there.<br>By the way, did you report our situation to Commander Chaisong?
Occur_String7=I did, but his situation wasn't so great at that time, either. He couldn't have done anything if he tried. Besides, the large-scale supply unit arrived at his base early. He probably thought it'd take care of the other bases sooner or later.
Occur_String8=Hm, I see. Then, did you find the report in our base over there?
Occur_String9=I took that report and talked to Yakan about it, but that was it.<br>I still don't know who this high-ranking officer mentioned in that report is.
Occur_String10=Hm... So, nothing has been solved.<br>Anyway, thanks. At least now I know how the overall situation is.
Doing_String=You look busy. Keep up the good work.<br>And thanks to you, our situation has improved a lot.

Complete_String=(Dracansor Talisman Quest) (2/13)<br>I asked Instructor Anan in the second defense base if the supply unit went by. She shook her head and said no supply unit came by since I left. I told her it already went by the base where Chaisong and the Drapia prince were. Anan sagely answered that it must have had a higher priority than her base because of the prince. But despite Anan's optimistic response, I started wondering if Yakan was trying to pull the wool over Chaisong's eyes and mine.

Occur_String3=Yes... for now. But thanks to you and Commander Chaisong, the enemy hasn't been attacking us as frequently as it used to.

Completable_String1=What the...? Where are the reinforcements? Why did you come in person?
Complete_String=(Dracansor Talisman Quest) (3/13)<br>The third defense base that I thought had received support more quickly than the others was actually in the worst situation. A guard at the base complained that the reinforcements systemically withdrew themselves until none of them remained after Chaisong and the prince left.

Occur_String3=You asked me to relay your situation to Yakan, so I did.<br>He said not to worry because he'd organized a large-scale support unit.
Occur_String4=It arrived at the defense base where Chaisong was, and he returned to the Command Center after seeing it arrive. He and I thought that reinforcements were sent to every defense base, as Yakan promised.

Occur_String7=That's what I want you to find out.<br>We're definitely missing something.
Doing_String=Being part of a big gorge, this place is abundant in minerals, but it still doesn't explain their rapid development.
Completable_String1=Err... What the...? You're not a Dracans. How did you get in here?
Complete_String=The soldier I met at the first defense base said that the Chakuas' armament has been becoming more elaborate as of late. It really doesn't make sense. They have to be getting outside help.
List_String=Look for High Purity Newk in the Chakuas' domain.
Mission_String=Find out why the Chakuas' armament continues to improve
Mission_Target1=High Purity Newk

Name=Hidden Power of the Chakuas 2
Occur_String1=I was going to ask you the same question. You look like an Arke Merchant. How did you get in here?
Occur_String2=Mm... That's a trade secret. But I can give you a hint: money talks.
Occur_String3=No, money doesn't always talk. I can prove it to you if you want. You should know, I'm also called the Strange Slaughterer.
Occur_String4=Heeek! I-I'm sorry! Please, don't kill me!
Occur_String5=If you don't want to die, then answer me honestly.<br>What are you Arke Merchants doing here?
Occur_String6=W-we heard about the high purity newk produced here in the Chakuas' territory. We've been negotiating with them for a long time.
Occur_String7=Apart from here, Newk of such high quality is only produced in Enova, and recently those dratted dwarves have become too greedy. We've decided to find a new supplier.
Occur_String8=Alright, then what are you offering them in exchange?
Occur_String9=The Chakuas also wanted to exchange with the outside world, so we said we'd provide them various supplies that they wanted, for small service fees. I can't tell you the exact items they wanted... They'd kill me.
Occur_String10=No, don't tell me. I can find out on my own.<br>Ah, and one more thing: always watch your tongue.
Doing_String=I will, I will. Anything you say, sir.
Completable_String1=Err? What are these contracts?
Completable_String2=I've found them in the Chakua domain over there. They prove that the Arke Merchants have provided the Chakuas with various supplies in exchange for the high-quality newk produced in their territory.
Completable_String3=Those Arkes. They'd do anything for money.<br>Thank you. I'll report to the Palace in a timely manner.
Complete_String=The Arke Merchants have been providing the Chakuas with various supplies in exchange for the high-quality newk produced in their territory. I didn't find any armament supply contracts between them, but the contracts I found showed that the Chakuas had been given anvils, hammers, and other supplies used for armament construction. It was the Arke Merchants who helped the Chakuas advance gradually while stuck in that isolated corner.

Occur_String3=I can do that.<br>By the way, do you know where the hostages are?
Occur_String4=You can ask that to the Chakuas behind me.<br>They were captured recently. They should know where they are.
Doing_String=Then, thank you in advance. Ah, and just so you know, the Chakuas might not understand you. Hah hah hah!
Completable_String1=Krrr...! Krrrkk!
Complete_String=Another Dracans soldier in the first base asked me to rescue his comrades who were dragged to the Chakuas' camp. He said he was asking a favor, but I could tell he wanted me to fail.

Occur_String4=Krrk... Krrrkk... Krrrkkk... (Pointing somewhere on the map)
Occur_String5=Mm... Okay, okay. I got it.<br>Then, take care.
Doing_String=Krrrrrk... Krrk...
Complete_String=I couldn't talk to the Chakua, so I threatened him with my weapon. He immediately understood me and pointed at the prisoners' location on the map.

Occur_String3=Mm... Do they have some sort of mark that they used to carry with them?<br>If they do, I can pick them up and bring them to the next base.
Occur_String4=Ah... Could you? We Drapia soldiers wear a necklace carrying our symbol. If you could collect and bring their necklaces, we'd have something to remember them by.
Doing_String=Thank you so much! All of us thank you for your noble act.
Completable_String1=Th-these... They're the marks of my fallen comrades.
Completable_String2=Yes. I collected as many of them as I could in the base over there in the back.<br>I hope they'll help appease their owners' spirits.

Occur_String1=Sir knight, please wait. Are thee heading f'r the base up north? Mind if I talketh to thee f'r a moment?
Occur_String2=Mm... What is it? (This Dracans has a pretty strange way of talking.)
Occur_String3=F'r now, I'm a mere trainee, but I've studied various military textbooks and I'd liketh to bethink I'm knowledgeable in military science.
Occur_String4=...So?
Occur_String5=So, in mine own opinion, because the thrashers are a f'rmidable foe, we shouldst planeth a long-term war by cutting off their supply instead of focusing on a war of attrition.
Occur_String6=You're saying we should get rid of the rations and supplies in the Dracans base, to cut off their food supply.
Occur_String7=You speak truth. This land is so infertile that nothing grows upon it. If thou were to get rid of the rations in the base, their morale will dropeth, given timeth.
Occur_String8=And when it does, just a small group of our elite soldiers can storm and round them up.<br>Alright, we can try that.
Doing_String=Thou art not only brave, but intelligent.<br>I'm impressed.
Complete_String=The Dracans trainee in the second defense base, who had a peculiar way of talking, suggested that we prepare a long-term war by getting rid of food in the Dracans Knights' base. I took his advice and burned all the food I saw and collected or destroyed other supplies.

Occur_String2=My comrade next to me helped me stop it.
Occur_String3=Your arm was cut off pretty cleanly. Did you lose it to thrashers?
Occur_String4=He was... the most dangerous Demon I've met.<br>I was lucky to lose just one arm.
Occur_String5=My comrades who were captured... According to the one next to me, he's keeping them in a cage, so he can slowly torture and kill them, one by one, whenever he feels like it.
Occur_String6=He sounds crazed and really dangerous. Alright, I'll take care of him.<br>What does he look like?
Occur_String7=He's much bigger than ordinary thrashers and carries a serrated blade in his hand.<br>If you see him, you'll instantly recognize him.
Doing_String=Please take care of him. Just the thought of him makes me feel these phantom pains in my arm that's no longer there.

Occur_String1=The thrashers raided our base in the wee hours of the morning, while most of us were asleep.
Occur_String2=They took us by surprise, killing and capturing most of us. Only a few of us were lucky to survive. We remain here now, resisting them.
Occur_String3=Those who were captured are destined to be tortured and executed, or become their meals.
Occur_String4=If you rescue them, I'll be forever in your debt.

Occur_String2=...Let me hear it first.
Occur_String3=The Blood Tooth tribe up north worships their own god named Garmax. This god looks slightly similar to the animal, belbee, and the tribe has its statues erected here and there in their domain to ward off evil energy.
Occur_String4=If you destroy these statues, they won't come out of their domain for a while. They'll be too busy restoring them.
Occur_String5=That should be easy enough.
Occur_String6=And one more thing: this directly has to do with this base's safety.
Occur_String7=...You're asking me to do more?
Occur_String8=Some time ago, they started collecting black oil in big wooden barrels. They can drop those barrels from up there, and we'll be sitting ducks.
Occur_String9=Mm... That sounds bad.
Occur_String10=It is. In a way, the future of this base depends on your decision.
Doing_String=We're lucky that Commander Chaisong has such a great friend like you.
Complete_String=The soldier in the third defense base had a great idea to delay the Blood Tooth invasion. The Blood Teeth living up north used statues of their god, Garmax, to ward off evil energy from their domain, and by destroying these statues, we would be able to break their will to fight and delay their invasion until they restore all of them. I destroyed a few of the statues in their domain, and also took care of all the oil barrels that they stocked up to attack the base, breaking their will to fight.

Occur_String2=Do you know me? I'm Kozel. I was carrying out my mission, reconning the Blood Teeth, when the Kunikuluses showed up and blocked my retreat route.
Occur_String3=Tunver told me.<br>Ah, don't worry about him. He returned to the defense base safely. I'll cut open a path for you. You should get back, too.
Occur_String4=I'm glad Tunver is safe. But I want to stay here until I find Pyron.
Occur_String5=That's not a good idea. The Kunikuluses can find you anytime.
Occur_String6=Then, could you find Pyron for me? He's in the same uniform as me. You won't miss him.
Doing_String=I really hope he's still alive. Then, I'll leave him to you and return to the Northern Defense Base.
Completable_String1=(The dead Dracans soldier's nametag reads "Pyron".)
Complete_String=In a corner of the Blood Tooth domain that had been occupied by the Kunikuluses, I met some isolated Dracans scouts.

Occur_String3=Mm... Okay, I'll avenge your death.<br>Then, rest in peace.
Doing_String=(The corpse's chest is caved in as if it was hit by something heavy.)
Completable_String1=Oh, no! Pyron... Curse them!
Completable_String2=It was the Kunikuluses. But he resisted until the end, like the brave Dracans warrior he was. What killed him was a blow to the chest, not the back.
Completable_String3=Pyron fought bravely until the end. Thank you, knight. Now we can return to our base without any regrets.
Complete_String=Judging by the injury to Pyron's chest, I was convinced that he was killed by the Kunikulus Foreman, who was noticeably bigger than other Kunikuluses. I defeated him and went back to where the other scouts were. They instantly knew what happened to their comrade, seeing that I was alone. As sad as it was, I delivered the news of Pyron's honorable death as a Dracans warrior to his comrades.

Occur_String6=Do you want me to get rid of them?
Occur_String7=No. We've still got enough manpower left to take care of them. I'm more worried about the southern defense line. I don't think the people there know the invading Demons, those gremlins, are closing in on this place.

Occur_String5=You want to help? Alright, then if you're willing to listen...<br>We combat priests of Bulcan are mainly tasked to escort the Elder Priests. That means we have to stay with them all the time.
Occur_String6=But we can't afford to just escort them anymore. A great many Dracanses are put in harm's way because of the monsters. Their numbers are just increasing too rapidly. Things were never this bad before.
Occur_String7=Then, why don't you take your combat priests and go out to fight them?
Occur_String8=I can't. The Elder Priests have to hold on to the Rift connected to an important place of ours. It requires a lot of concentration, and even the subtlest threat to their safety can make them vulnerable.
Occur_String9=So, you were sighing because you didn't know what to do.<br>Then, how about I cull the monsters? Would that help?
Occur_String10=Really?<br>Then, please take care of cave frog beasts and deliver their skin to Dracans Knight Panaru in the southern defense line. He said he needed frog beast skin, too.

Complete_String=Bulcan's high-ranking combat priests can't leave their charges, the Elder Priests who maintain the Rift in the outpost. One of them asked me to defeat the threatening cave frog beasts for the Dracanses and deliver their skins to Dracans Knight Panaru in the southern defense line.

Occur_String1=Psst! Wait! Please don't go. I-I've got a favor to ask of you!
Occur_String2=What? You said I'd be an enemy once I left this place. Do you Chakuas ask your enemies favors?
Occur_String3=Psst! You're still in front of me. Technically, you haven't left yet. So, please do this for me.<br>My son, Lafuaku, hasn't returned. He went to recon the Rift that's swarming with thrashers, and we haven't heard from him yet.
Occur_String4=I'm worried he might have been caught and dragged into the Rift by the thrashers. Please find my son.
Occur_String5=I don't believe this!<br>Well, I didn't know you Chakuas also sent out your chief's sons on recon missions.
Occur_String6=Psst! All of us Chakuas are great warriors. We take on any missions we must. But I'm still worried about my son. Please find him.
Doing_String=Psst! Please hurry. My son is called Lafuaku.
Completable_String1=Psst! Psssst! You killed an army of thrashers by yourself. Wh-who are you!?

Occur_String2=Yes. He was worried since he didn't hear back from you.
Occur_String3=Thank you. All the thrashers are dead now. Lafuaku can now walk out of here alive. Thank you so much.
Occur_String4=But there's a problem.<br>Lafuaku was trapped and dragged to this place. Lafuaku's good at scouting. He hides well. Never got caught by thrashers.
Occur_String5=What are you talking about?
Occur_String6=Some Chakuas are not happy with their chief. I saw them collude, and they left me here. Those Chakua Mace-bearers... They're not happy with the Chief for using Dracans weapons. If left alone, they'll hurt the Chief.
Occur_String7=If your chief dies, the rest of you will scatter.<br>I can't let that happen. Those stupid Chakuas are putting an even bigger burden on me.
Occur_String8=Strong knight, please! Get rid of those Chakua Mace-bearers that threaten the chief!
Doing_String=Chakua Mace-bearers are strong. Even you'll have a hard time dealing with them.
Completable_String1=Psst! Psssst! You killed an army of thrashers by yourself. Wh-who are you!?
Complete_String=I found the Chief's son, Lafuaku, on the other side of the Rift. He said he was trapped and that some Chakua Mace-bearers were threatening the Chief.

Occur_String2=Wounded Dracans soldiers. They're in a lot of pain.
Occur_String3=Yes, that's correct. Right now, these people are fighting for their lives. The herbs that you brought only helped them for a little while.
Occur_String4=I can't ignore their pain. Aren't there more effective herbs around here?
Occur_String5=Yes, there are.<br>But they're in such a dangerous place that I'm hesitant to direct you there.
Occur_String6=You wouldn't have told me about this if you thought I couldn't handle it. Where are they?
Occur_String7=They're on the other side of the Rift, north from the southern defense base. Cave mushrooms growing by the waterside are effective for pain. But please be careful: they're where the heinous thrashers show up.
Doing_String=Our warriors are in a lot of pain. Please hurry.
Completable_String1=Yes, these are the rare cave mushrooms!<br>They'll help relieve our soldiers' pain for a while. Thank you so much!
Complete_String=The effect of the herbs I brought the last time wore off, leaving the Dracanses in more pain. Dracans Juro couldn't bear watching them anymore, so he asked me to get the cave mushrooms that were effective for pain relief, but grew on the other, dangerous, side of the Rift.

Occur_String1=Strange Knight, do you mind me asking you a favor?
Occur_String2=You're pretty polite for a Dracans Knight.<br>No, I don't mind at all. What do you need?
Occur_String3=You know this base is having a problem with the Kunikuluses, the invading Demons from the Rift, right? Their watchmen that carry strange-looking bundles and swing pickaxes are the most troublesome.
Occur_String4=Mm... You want me to enter the Rift and take care of their watchmen. Sure, that can be arranged.
Occur_String5=Ah, not exactly. I'd like you to defeat the watchmen and collect their bundles. This may not be the best time to ask you this, but I have a personal interest in their bundles.
Occur_String6=A personal interest? Some of you Dracanses are as peculiar as some humans.
Occur_String7=I'm the type who can't sleep when he's curious about something. Please collect their bundles, so I can sleep at night.
Doing_String=Ah! Their bundles might be a little bit heavy, but please don't discard their contents.
Completable_String1=Oh! This strange pattern! They must be the Kunikuluses' bundles<br>Mm... They're smellier than I thought, but I can deal with it. By the way, I can't wait to see what's inside them!

Name=Remove Threats
Occur_String1=Hey, you radiate extraordinary energy. You're as special as I've heard!
Occur_String2=Is that a compliment? I haven't heard many of those since I arrived in Dracansor. Compliments are nice... as long as there's no hidden agenda behind them.
Occur_String3=Wh-what hidden agenda? I-I just said what I thought. Hah... hah hah hah!
Occur_String4=I knew it. I didn't think your compliment was sincere. No need to panic.<br>What do you want?
Occur_String5=Hah hah hah! Fine, you've got me.<br>I've heard you're planning to raid the Kunikulus den. If you go there, you'll notice an unfamiliar type that you won't have seen around here.
Occur_String6=Kunikulus Supervisors. They shoot some evil magic at us Dracans Knights, keeping us at bay.
Occur_String7=Evil magic? Hm... Since you Dracans Knights are melee fighters, they're tricky to get rid of.
Occur_String8=Yes. So, I'd like you to get rid of as many Kunikulus Supervisors as you can. We'll have to take them on soon, and I want to eliminate as many threats as I can beforehand.<br>You can handle them, can't you?
Doing_String=Now, go show them what you've got!
Completable_String1=Ah! I already heard what you did. You completely destroyed the Kunikuluses' camp on the other side of the Rift. You also took care of most of their supervisors, so we Dracans Knights could finish off the rest easily. Thank you!

Name=Purple Scales
Occur_String1=Strange Knight, if you're not busy, can I ask you one more favor?
Occur_String2=Does it also have to do with your personal curiosity? That'd be selfish. Your comrades are dying to protect their country.
Occur_String3=No, it does not. Well, in a way, it does, but it also benefits the others.
Occur_String4=Okay, that's fine with me. What is it?
Occur_String5=As you know, this place is inhabited by the local Blood Tooth tribe. And it's keeping the invading Demons, Kunikuluses, at bay. It's the reason we haven't been completely wiped out yet.
Occur_String6=But recently it's been sending scouts to our encampment, to spy on us. So far, we've managed to repel them, but if they find out how desperate our situation is, they won't hesitate to launch an attack on us.
Occur_String7=That won't be good. We can't risk tipping the scale to one side, so we should just cut down the number of their scouts and discourage them from spying on us. By the way, how does your curiosity fit into this?
Occur_String8=The Blood Tooth Scouts' skin is optimized for spying. Their purple skin is hard to see in the nighttime, and in the daytime, it reflects sunlight, creating a protective coloring effect.
Occur_String9=You want me to kill their scouts and get their skin? That's pretty gruesome.
Occur_String10=I really want to know how their skin works. Knowing that can definitely help us Dracanses, too. So, please eliminate Blood Tooth Scouts and bring me their skin.
Doing_String=You'll have to go deep inside their encampment to find them. Ah, am I worrying for nothing?

Occur_String3=Hah hah hah! It's something you can handle. I'd like you to eliminate the Blood Tooth Assassins that are threatening us Dracans Knights.
Occur_String4=That's easier said than done. Why, was one of your group assassinated?
Occur_String5=No, fortunately not. But they tried. Several times. Even yesterday, a Blood Tooth Assassin tried to sneak into the commander's tent.
Occur_String6=Isn't the commander's tent in the deepest part of your encampment? Your security must be sloppier than I thought.
Occur_String7=Or it could mean that the Blood Tooth Assassins are really good at what they do. So, please eliminate them for us Dracans Knights.

Occur_String3=Yes. Absolutely. Speaking of which, could you do me one last favor? This also has to do with the northern defense base where your next test takes place.
Occur_String4=It has to do with my next test, huh? Okay, I'm all ears.

Occur_String6=Yes, I remember. They were pretty tough to deal with. Are there more of them?
Occur_String7=These ones are much stronger than the others: Kunikulus Adjutants. The energy that they shoot from their hands is so evil that many Dracans Knights in the northern base already fell victim to them. I want you to get rid of them on your way to the base.
Doing_String=Don't let your guard down. They're not easy targets!

Name=The missing prince Briant
Occur_String1=Prince Briant has gone missing. Chaisong himself was escorting him. What a leader he is. Perhaps the reputation of Drakan knights was exaggerated.
Occur_String2=What happened to Chaisong?
Occur_String3=He's fine. According to Chaisong, there was a brilliant flash and the prince was gone. The king has ordered to chain Chaisong in the dungeons for failing the escort of the prince.
Occur_String4=Who in the world...! Could it be the remnants of Yakan? But, is there anyone left who can kidnap before the leader of the Drakan knights?
Occur_String5=That's what we should find out. On top of that, I got intel that the forces of Lorensia kingdom are marching to our capital. I always said that they will show their true colors one day!
Occur_String6=This is not a simple case. It doesn't make sense that Chaisong couldn't do anything. We must also check if Lorensia is indeed making a move, or if it is only a part of them, such as the Nobles' alliance.
Occur_String7=I'll go there in person to find out what's happening. Where is the army of Lorensia now?
Occur_String8=At Qahanaan approach. That's why I tried to find you. Go and keep an eye on Lorensia. I will also reward you if you could take care of them.

Completable_String2=Goddamn... what's the Devias knights doing here? Did Lorensia really start a war?
Completable_String3=No. The ones attacking Drakans now are the troops of the Nobles' alliance. We were spying on them on behalf of Muren. Adrian claims innocence on their part, but who can believe him.
Completable_String4=I see. Drakans thinks that Lorensia is invading them. They must know that this is solely by the Nobles' alliance. Or there is going to be a full-scale war for sure.

Occur_String2=So... you know about that as well. Actually, it wasn't so long ago that we learnt about that. But I don't understand. Nobody in the Nobles' alliance is skilled enough to kidnap the prince in the presence of the leader of the Drakan knights. I'm sure about that.
Occur_String3=I can hardly believe it myself, but under the circumstances, they are the most likely suspect...
Occur_String4=Hmm... How about you visit our base to the north, then. You'll find 'Gaion' there, who is leading the Devias knights deployed here.<br>This is our badge, please take it. Gaion will cooperate once you show this badge.
Occur_String5=I don't think anyone on Myu continent will refuse the support of the Devias knights. Thanks a lot.<br>But you know... I get a very bad feeling from over there. What happened?
Occur_String6=It seems there was a surprise attack by the Nobles' alliance around here. When we got here, there were a lot of fallen Drakans, and wild animals were already gathering. We tried to help...

Occur_String5=It's as if they hold a grudge on the land; they are putting huge amounts of bags of salt on our lands. If all that salt got spread on the farmlands... The land will be damaged beyond repair for growing crops ever again!
Occur_String6=Well, that is on my way. Okay. I'll see to it.
Occur_String7=Thank you, sir knight! Also, if you're heading to Qahanaan, I'll be truly grateful if you could check the situation at the reservoir just up there!
Occur_String8=... Damn. All right.
Doing_String=I hope the Lorensians haven't done anything to the reservoir... I'm worried...
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (6/76)<br>Fortunately, I could stop the atrocity of the Nobles' alliance spreading salt on the farmers' land. According to the words of the farmer who informed me of the atrocity of the Nobles' alliance, there is a reservoir above this farm, which holds the water for their farming for the whole year. Considering the atrocious plan to salt the farmlands, they must also be extending their evil deed to the reservoir as well. I have to hurry.

Completable_String1=Wh- Who is it? Identify yourself!<br>... This area is covered by the Nobles' alliance troops, so how did you get here?
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (7/76)<br>As expected, it seems a battle broke out between the Drapian royal troops guarding the reservoir and the Nobles' alliance troops at the reservoir above the farmhouse. But it seems that the Drapian royal troops were slaughtered, and the path was full of scattered with corpses of the Drapian royal troops.

Name=The danger lurking in the management office
Occur_String1=Well, maybe because I'm capable of it? But what is important is not my identity.<br>What's going on here?
Occur_String2=The Nobles' alliance bastards said they are going to poison the waterway in this management office.<br>We want to stop it, but there's nothing we can do because we're no match for them.
Occur_String3=Poison the waterway? Where does the waterway lead to?
Occur_String4=The farm under here for a start, but it's connected all the way to Qahanaan, the kingdom's capital. If they poison the water here...<br>They're also planning to poison outside. Someone around here must have the poison for that.
Occur_String5=Could you lend us that 'capability' that you were so confident about?<br>We'll be grateful if you take away the poison of the Nobles' alliance outside, and also take care of the ones inside the management office. I know it is shameful and embarrassing to ask such things to an outsider, but our situation is at its worst...
Occur_String6=It's a wise decision. You're all gonna die if you get bound with such trivialities. I'll find a way somehow. Just stop anyone from getting inside.
Occur_String7=Oh, and the chief of the management must be captured in there. It would be great if you could check if he's still alive.<br>We will guard the outside with our lives.
Doing_String=To see such things as an honorable member of the Drapian royal army... It is such a disgrace!
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (8/76)<br>I collected all the poison from the Nobles' alliance guys outside of the reservoir. Now I have to take care of the Nobles' alliance inside of the management office.
List_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (8/76)<br>According to the words of a Drapian soldier who was hiding in a corner of the reservoir, the Nobles' alliance was planning to spread the poison through the waterway here, which was connected all the way to the capital. I have to stop their plan before they poison the waterway, the sooner the better.
Mission_String=Collect the poison from the Nobles' alliance troops in the vicinity of the reservoir, and get into the management office

Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (9/76)<br>The underground of the management office was already full of Nobles' alliance troops. Fortunately, they hadn't received the orders to poison the waterway yet, and the jars of poison were just positioned all around the waterway. Hastening, I defeated the Nobles' alliance troops surrounding the waterway and broke every single one of the poison jars.

Name=The remnants in the reservoir management office
Occur_String1=Well, it's easier to think something like that. I do have other matters to attend to... Then things just went by its own way.<br>How are you doing? Are there any others here?
Occur_String2=There is one Nobles' alliance officer with great skills guarding the door. Our warriors guarding this place tried to take care of him, but they were all slain beneath his blade.
Occur_String3=Okay. Get out of here, quickly. You'll be okay if you get out the way I came.
Occur_String4=What about you, sir knight?
Occur_String5=I'm going to deal with the skilled guy. Nobody like him has ever survived me until now.<br>Anyway, just get out fast. Don't wait for me. After I'm done here, I'm going right back to what I was doing.
Doing_String=Then god speed.
Completable_String1=Wait, what's that badge? How did you come by it, when you're not a member of us?
Completable_String2=One of your members I met on the mountain path gave it to me, saying that it will come in handy.
Completable_String3=Then, you're %s_9_1? I got the message from Nicky by the homing pigeon. Well you got here later than I expected. What happened?
Completable_String4=Well, a few things... god damn those Nobles' alliance.
Completable_String5=Ha. I like your choice of words. Goddamned Nobles' alliance. Anyway, happy to meet you. I'm Gaion. I heard about you a lot. You're almost the definition of a hero. I'd like to ask for sparring, but we can't afford that now. Real bummer.
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (10/76)<br>As I got out of the reservoir management office and walk in the direction pointed out by Devias Nicky, I found the secret camp of Devias shortly. When I showed the badge that Nicky gave me to the guy with fire-red hair, he introduced himself as Gaion and said he has heard a lot about me.

[Quest_5711]
Name=Request of Devias knights
Occur_String1=Too bad, we don't have any information about the Drakans prince either. I'm amazed myself. A disappeared prince is a huge matter, but there are so few clues.
Occur_String2=Right... the Nobles' alliance suddenly attacking Drakans, and the prince gone... The situation is as chaotic as it gets.<br>Well, for now, the Nobles' alliance is the most suspicious.
Occur_String3=Then how about you stop the Nobles' alliance with us from now on? As you said so yourself, they are the most suspicious, so maybe you'll find a clue while fighting against them. Nor do you seem to have any other solutions now. Of course, we'll let you know at once if we find out anything.
Occur_String4=Hm... that seems to be the best choice for now. Okay. I'll accept your proposal. How can I help you?
Occur_String5=So cool. Okay. Currently there are three urgent matters. First is to exterminate the Nobles' alliance troops in the area. Well, that's a given. Second, we have to rescue Drakans prisoners captured by the Nobles' alliance; go see the Drakans agent in hiding for this matter. That's the location. And third, request support from Harry, who is in charge of our logistics. So, which one...
Occur_String6=Hm... Harry's near where the Drakans agent is. That's good.<br>I will sweep up the Nobles' alliance around here, rescue the prisoners, and find Harry. So that's it?
Occur_String7=... Huh? You're going to handle all three of them? Aren't you straining yourself? That's not easy even for someone like...
Occur_String8=It's a piece of cake, compared to what I've been through.
Doing_String=That rat of a man, Adrian... I'm not going to let him off easy when I get my hands on him.
Completable_String1=Wh-Who is it? How did you get here? Are you a mercenary on the Nobles' alliance side?
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (11/76)<br>I couldn't find any information regarding the prince, but considering the situation, there's a high chance that the Nobles' alliance had something to do with the kidnapping of the prince. So I've decided to join hands with the Devias knights who were investigating the Nobles' alliance.<br>The Devias knights told me about the three missions of Gaion and asked me to choose one, but it won't be so hard as the routes are similar. I will sweep up the Nobles' alliance around here first, then go to rescue the prisoners.
List_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (11/76)<br>Sweep up the surrounding Nobles' alliance troops who are threatening the Devias secret camp, then find the Drakans agent to rescue the Drakans prisoners.

[Quest_5712]
Name=The captured Drakans prisoners
Occur_String1=I'm not, so calm down. I'm a contract knight working with the Devias knights. I heard that the Nobles' alliance took the Drakans as prisoners, can you tell me what happened exactly?
Occur_String2=Contract knight of the Devias knights? I'm surprised that the Devias would hire a contract knight. You must have great powers... but I haven't heard that someone like that came here. Who are you?
Occur_String3=%s_9_1. Most people recognize my name. I got a little famous, unwillingly.
Occur_String4=%s_9_1! It can't be, you are '%s_9_1? Oh my... I've been disrespectful. It's my first time to actually see you...
Occur_String5=That's fine. That kind of formality makes me nervous. And welcoming me isn't the important thing right now, is it?
Occur_String6=Ah, yes. The Nobles' alliance took not only the warriors but common Drakans as prisoners. Probably as hostages, but anyway we have to rescue them.
Occur_String7=They are located southeast from here. Please take care of the Nobles' alliance troops there, and free the prisoners so they can escape. Luckily, they had to cut a lot of corners to build a prison, so the troops nor the facility should be heavy.
Occur_String8=Okay. So, it won't waste a lot of time if I head right on to the next point after freeing the prisoners.
Doing_String=Please get them back to their families.
Completable_String1=Ah, finally here! I've been contacted by Gaion. I'm Harry. Do you remember me?
Completable_String2=Right. I thought the name was familiar, now I can be sure after seeing your face. Walkreeger ruins, right?
Completable_String3=Right. You remembered me, that's an honor.
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (12/76)<br>I checked the situation by meeting the Drakans agent that the Devias mentioned, freed the Drakans prisoners and killed the Nobles' alliance troops to help the prisoners escape. Things are happening all at once, haphazardly.<br>After liberating the prisoners I went to see Harry, who turned out to be the nerd I met at the Walkreeger ruins.

Name=The formidable cannon
Occur_String1=I'd love to ask all about what happened since, but let's get off that for now.<br>The Nobles' alliance have come far enough to deploying a cannon. It's still in preparation, but soon they'll be firing everywhere. Then it's only a matter of time before pandemonium.
Occur_String2=And you were just sitting on your ass? How could you let such a thing happen? You and Drakans, both.
Occur_String3=... This is going to sound lame, but we're not as free as you are. We are bound to various limitations, such as politics and power. And few in numbers.<br>Drakans cannot cope well with this situation as the damage from the battle against demons was severe. That's why they are in the current state.
Occur_String4=From what I know, some kind of negotiation is going on between the Drakans and the Nobles' alliance. Of course it is to end this war, but if they reach an agreement in the current situation...
Occur_String5=It will be very disadvantageous for the Drakans, and that much advantageous for the Nobles' alliance. That's the worst.
Occur_String6=So this may sound ridiculous, but maybe it is inevitable that you are here. To save the Drakans, and stop the Nobles' alliance.<br>Anyway, the biggest threat now are those cannons. The cannons have to be removed before they open fire. And you're the only one who can do it.
Doing_String=It's a very confusing situation.
Completable_String1=You've done a terrific job. If those cannons opened fire, there would be no solutions. We were very lucky. If you were on the side of the Nobles' alliance... Aw, I don't even want to think about it.
Completable_String2=Neither do I. Me, on their side. That's terrible.
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (13/76)<br>As I thought, Harry was the person I met before at Walkreeger ruins. He summarized the current situation to me, and said the Nobles' alliance cannons are a big threat. Anyway, I got rid of the cannons and the artillery units operating them.

Occur_String3=That will be even better. So then, can you go and find something there? I don't know exactly, but I'm sure you'll find something.

Occur_String3=Then where did they deploy the demons? Can you check?
Occur_String4=It says... South of Qahanaan, the capital. It seems they will occupy the villages and food storages with demons in the area. And it seems all this is an experiment. To see if they can continue to use them in the future.
Occur_String5=... I thought this will be a simple operation to find and return the runaway prince, and it turns out to be war and demons. Whatever is going on. Things are going way south.

Occur_String1=Anyway, I'm glad you survived. Do you know who they are, and why they did this?
Occur_String2=These are the troops of the Nobles' alliance disguised as hunters, and they seemed to be quite the elites. I heard them talking by chance. They said we would be used for hostages in some kind of negotiation. That's the only reason they kept us alive.
Occur_String3=Also, I think their true purpose was not us. Up that way, there is the castle wall of capital Qahanaan, and I saw them moving something there again and again. I don't know what it was... But I guess it wasn't anything good.

Occur_String7=Oh, gosh! You're really %s_9_1? It's such an honor! You slaying the demons was nothing short of astounding. Again...
Occur_String8=It is not the right time to talk about these things. I have to go to the place that you mentioned right now, can you lead these people back to the village?
Occur_String9=Sure. Because you took care of the ones here.<br>So, god speed. Stop their plots and help us. Please.
Doing_String=And god speed.
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (25/76)<br>According to what the Drakans villager said, the Lorensian hunters who were garrisoned here were actually Nobles' alliance elites disguised as hunters. He said they were moving some stuff to the Qahanaan castle wall... Nothing good, I suppose.

Completable_String1=From the other side? Hey, who are you? How did you penetrate those guys!
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (26/76)<br>The troops of the Nobles' alliance disguised as hunters were already lining up bombs along the outer castle wall. It seemed that disarming the bombs was more urgent than informing this to the Drapian royal guards. I hurriedly smashed the Nobles' alliance getting in my way, and disarmed the bombs placed at the castle wall.

[Quest_5727]
Name=An audience with the king
Occur_String1=I am %s_9_1. Chairman Quadro sent me. If you want proof, me breaking through there should be enough. What were the guards doing, when the Nobles' alliance were placing bombs on the castle walls? Planning to enjoy the fireworks later?
Occur_String2=%s_9_1! I wasn't expecting to meet the hero who saved the nation. I'm honored. But bombs! What were those evil bastards up to!
Occur_String3=We have been bound here on the orders to stand by until the discussion with the Nobles' alliance was over.<br>%s_9_1, if your words are true, that will be more than enough to justify us guards making our move. Our blood was boiling as we could only watch their violations anyway.
Occur_String4=I see. Then you should hurry. I took care of all the bombs there were, but they'll surely be back. Organize the troops and defend the castle walls.<br>It's not only here, either. I think it's safe to say that all of Qahanaan approach is now under their control. And report to the king immediately.
Occur_String5=In that case, %s_9_1, maybe it will be best if you make the report in person. Tell the king everything you have seen so far.
Occur_String6=If anyone tries to stop you, just show them this nameplate. They'll let you through. Or maybe, telling them of your name, %s_9_1, may be more effective.<br>Here, please go inside. We will guard this place with our lives.
Doing_String=%s_9_1 helping us must be the biggest blessing for the kingdom.
Completable_String1=Wait, aren't you %s_9_1?
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (27/76)<br>After I explained to the chief guard what was going on, the chief guard handed me his nameplate and requested I have an audience with the king at once. On my way to the castle, a Silver sparrowhawk called me over. These guys are really all over the place.

[Quest_5728]
Name=A message from Kundun
Occur_String1=A Silver sparrowhawk? You guys are here too?
Occur_String2=It's not widely known, but Silver sparrowhawk has a friendly relationship with the royalty of Drapia. Sure, we are different in sides and religion, but we focus on seeking the truth and research. And we share the benefits by sharing the results of our studies with Drapia.
Occur_String3=Seems like a pretty nice symbiotic relationship. So, what did you want to tell me?
Occur_String4=Lemuria is looking for you, %s_9_1. She's one of the best disciples of Kundun.<br>She had a meeting with his majesty of Drapia, Kaselhike, but as she's not back, I'm sure she is at the envoy residence there.
Occur_String5=Lemuria? Hmm... that sounds familiar. In that case, I suppose Kundun is looking for me. Maybe he has something to tell me.
Occur_String6=Yes, that's right. So if it's okay with you, could you wait just a moment? She'll be out soon.
Occur_String7=I won't need to wait. I have something to say to king Drapia myself. If she's in there, I'll go to Lemuria after I talk with the king.<br>But then, how did you know I'll be here?
Occur_String8=Kundun told me. If something went wrong, %s_9_1 would surely be there.
Occur_String9=Ha... damn it.
Doing_String=There's a place for envoys at the east of the castle.
Completable_String1=Greetings, your highness. I am '%s_9_1', a contract knight. I have come for an audience in person, as I had to debrief what was going on outside of here.
Completable_String2=Yeah... You are the hero Chaisong was always talking about? This is the first time we've actually met. Drapia is greatly indebted to you. Belatedly, I would like to express my gratitude.<br>So, what is it that you would like to tell me?
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (28/76)<br>The one who stopped me was a member of the Silver sparrowhawk, sent by Kundun's best pupil, Lemuria. He said that Kundun wants to deliver a message by his best pupil Lemuria, and asked me to wait until Lemuria came out of the castle. As I had business in the castle myself, I told him I'd see her inside and went to see the king of Drapia first.
List_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (28/76)<br>Go to castle Drapia and meet the king of Drapia, then I have to meet Lemuria at the envoy's stay within the castle.
Mission_String=Go to castle Drapia and have an audience with the king of Drapia
Mission_Target1=Talk with the king of Drapia

[Quest_5729]
Name=Kundun's best disciple, Lemuria
Occur_String1=Firstly, the ones invading Drapia are the troops of the Nobles' alliance. They are part of the Lorensia kingdom, but in reality, they are personal soldiers of Adrian. Therefore, all responsibility should be aimed at this Adrian.
Occur_String2=Just as I thought. I knew that there was no way Lorensia would get this low. Those are the ones who caused chaos at the Blood highlands and blood-ice mountain with demons. Of course, I will have to hold Lorensia responsible, but I can fully understand what you're saying. Your words will be taken into utmost consideration.
Occur_String3=Also, I understand that the kingdom is making negotiations with the Nobles' alliance at this point. But this is their trick, acting sincere on the surface, but on their backs, they are deploying special forces to set up bombs at the castle walls.
Occur_String4=It's an outrage! Listen! Pass on to the chief guard to wipe out the scoundrels at once!
Occur_String5=I have already suppressed one of their groups, and informed the chief guard about it. The chief guard headed to the castle walls with troops, and asked me to inform everything I knew to your majesty.
Occur_String6=Although Qahanaan approach is mostly occupied by the Nobles' alliance, their evil plotting hasn't reached anywhere else. Therefore, I daresay that it will not be a serious threat to national defense if we deploy all of the available forces and strike the Nobles' alliance here. In my opinion, the first priority should be to retake the Qahanaan approach, so it will be wise to command for this.
Occur_String7=Ah, that is fortunate indeed. That takes a load of weight off my chest. I will take your advice.<br>And... I've heard from chairman Quadro, so is...
Occur_String8=Ah, the whereabouts of prince Briant... unfortunately, I haven't got the clues to that yet. However, it seems that his disappearance has nothing to do this the current war. Maybe this is another case...
Occur_String9=*Sigh*... It's all my shortcoming... Lacking of virtue.
Occur_String10=In all honesty, your highness, we need to make a move rather than be discouraged. Please do what as highness sees fit.<br>If I may be excused.
Doing_String=You're right, I can't get on like this. I should act like the king. That was a shameful action on my part.
Completable_String1=Yes, I heard that you were looking for me. What is it?
Completable_String2=So, you're %s_9_1. It's an honor. I have heard so much about you from Kundun, it feels off and familiar... kind of a strange feeling.
Completable_String3=We have some information, and it's quite a bit more serious than expected. So, to review the situation, Kundun has sent me to share the information with %s_9_1.
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (29/76)<br>I told everything I knew to the king of Drakans. If he is a capable king, he will not fall back in his chair but will take positive actions in what he must do. There is nothing more for me to do, so I visited this Lemuria that the Silver sparrowhawk mentioned.
List_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (29/76)<br>I told everything I knew to king Kaselhike. Now I will go to the envoy's residence and talk to Lemuria.
Mission_String=Go to the envoy's residence

[Quest_5730]
Name=The unidentified murderous aura from the throne
Occur_String1=The chaos crystal fragment has been stolen by someone. The one which was sealed after defeating death lore. And Quadro, the chairman of the Drapia Senate is gone.
Occur_String2=Damn. This kind of talk is going to stick. How much stuff is going on at once.<br>So you're saying that Quadro stole it? For what purpose?
Occur_String3=There's no proof, but under the circumstances Quadro is the most likely culprit for now.<br>And... this is a baseless conspiracy, but if we assume that Quadro was the mastermind behind the scenes, everything falls into place.
Occur_String4=... You don't say! Had Quadro induced the Nobles' alliance and plotted the abduction of the prince? To steal the chaos crystal?
Occur_String5=Yes. Although weakened by the battle against demons, Drakans is not a species which will fall so easily at the hands of the Nobles' alliance. But if Quadro, the chairman of the Senate, planned it all, it's very possible. Being the person inside, and from the highest position at that.
Occur_String6=So, he 'planned' the prince's abduction, to get rid of Chaisong, who could be his biggest obstacle. Because it will be almost impossible to deal with Chaisong directly.<br>Wait, in that case, why did he draw me into all this? I was quite the pain in the ass, as well.
Occur_String7=I suppose, to avoid suspicion. Also, he must have manipulated %s_9_1 to deal with the Nobles' alliance so you couldn't focus on him.
Occur_String8=That kind of makes sense then.<br>So then, what in the world is this chaos crystal? What is...<br>.....<br>Shh, hold on..!
Occur_String9=Huh? What's wrong?
Occur_String10=Something's strange. We'll talk later. Something doesn't feel right. I sense hostility from outside. I have to go.
Doing_String=What the hell is going on?

Name=A tragedy brought on by twisted faith
Occur_String1=Calm down and listen to me. In the current situation, if you can't handle it, all of Drapia may fall. You have to keep cool. Understand?
Occur_String2=Yes, yes, yes.
Occur_String3=Go to the Senate and high officials at once and tell them what happened. The confusion will only grow with time. But try to be as discreet as possible. It's impossible to stop such an important thing from leaking, but we have to delay it as much as possible. Or else, the Nobles' alliance will get here before we are fully prepared.
Occur_String4=Also, reinstate Chaisong from the dungeons at once and inform him of this situation. He'll take care of military preparations. At least the capital Qahanaan won't fall into the hands of Nobles' alliance.
Occur_String5=I... I got it.
Occur_String6=I will find the reason behind this and track him down. Tell Chaisong that I'm pursuing Quadro.<br>I know it's troubling and hard, but everything is on your shoulders.
Doing_String=I... I'll do it.
Completable_String1=You were right. The chairman Quadro assassinated the king. It seems that he was behind everything that happened.<br>Do you know why this has happened? It doesn't look like a personal grudge.
Completable_String2=Oh my... even I didn't know he could be this extreme.<br>King Kaselhike and Quadro used to be on the same political track, but through the rebellion of prince Ungpam and expulsion, and death, their ways have become polarized. Quadro insisted a strong Drakans, but Kaselhike was all for stability.
Completable_String3=I suppose Quadro joined hands with the Nobles' alliance and started a war, and used that consciousness to build a firm system as before. But Kaselhike was having negotiations with the Nobles' alliance instead of fighting, so he couldn't bear it any longer.
Completable_String4=It's a case of twisted faith gone berserk. Then what is the chaos crystal? I can't imagine the chairman of the Senate doing something so reckless.
Completable_String5=The chaos crystal is known to be a part of Sekneum, the demon god. It is the purest crystal of magical aura.
Completable_String6=Then isn't it really dangerous?
Completable_String7=Yes. But it's not that simple to use. Because the magic stored in it is too powerful. To put into words, it's like the strongest beverage, almost too strong to wet your lips, up to the brim of a house-sized barrel. Compared to that, we are like a tiny, children's toy-sized teacup filled with plain water.
Completable_String8=What happens if you pour such a strong drink? A single drop will be enough to mix and utterly change the water in the teacup. If he makes the tiniest mistake with the chaos crystal one tiny bit, he will lose control of his existence in a blink of an eye. Then what? Cease to exist, literally.
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (33/76)<br>I requested the shivering royal grand chamberlain to inform the situation to the Senate and high officials, and to reinstate Chaisong from the dungeons to calm down the castle. Then I returned to Lemuria and asked for the reason why this has happened. She told me about the argument about the political track between king Kaselhike and Quadro, and that must have been the reason. Also, she said that the chaos crystal that he took with him is known to be a part of Sekneum, the demon god, and it is very hard and dangerous to handle because it is pure crystallized magic.
List_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (33/76)<br>Return to the envoy's residency and get Lemuria's advice. She was the one who said Quadro was the mastermind, so maybe she has other information.
Mission_String=Gather information from Lemuria in the envoy's residence
Mission_Target1=Talk with Lemuria

[Quest_5734]
Name=Pursue the assassinator of the king
Occur_String1=Even so, we can't just let Quadro walk free. Maybe he found out other means of using the chaos crystal, and even if he didn't, Drapia will fall politically if we don't catch him.<br>Do you have any other information on him? Any information that may tell us where he's headed.
Occur_String2=Karon has more information of that kind than myself. He is a Silver sparrowhawk and the branch chief of Qahanaan, and every piece of information we gather in this area is initially reported to Karon. He's to the east as you exit the castle, so you may want to pay him a visit. I'll sort out the situation here and follow immediately.
Doing_String=You'll find him to the east, after getting out of the castle.
Completable_String1=Nice to meet you. I'm Karon, in charge of Qahanaan branch, of the Silver sparrowhawk. We would have had a grand welcome, but please understand, considering the current situation.
Completable_String2=I wouldn't want it anyway. I'll get to the chase; do you have any collected information on Quadro?
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (34/76)<br>Agreeing to Lemuria's advice, I got out of the castle and reached the mark on the map. As I enter the building, a man who introduces himself as the branch chief of Qahanaan is waiting for me.

[Quest_5735]
Name=Sanctuary of Drakans
Occur_String1=Fine. The most urgent matter will be the direction where Quadro, chairman of the Senate, is headed. After tracking with the leftover magical powers in the castle, Quadro headed to the 'Luiziane falls', which lies in the north of the castle.
Occur_String2=According to legends that go back to the ancient Walkreeger empire period, there is a huge cave behind the Luiziane falls, and from there, the species of Drakans was created by Vulcan, one of the greatest gods in heaven, and the ancient dragon Kaisel.
Occur_String3=If he stole the chaos crystal and fled that way...
Occur_String4=There must be something in the cave of the Luiziane falls that only he knows about, and maybe he can control the chaos crystal at his will. If that is the case, it will be a terribly big threat to us.
Occur_String5=Then we must follow immediately. Luiziane falls, huh. We have to stop him before he does anything. Thanks. Let me know if you get any more information.
Doing_String=Actually, Kundun tried to come here by himself, but he couldn't make it because currently he is worrying about the countermeasures with Icarus, as the movement of the forces of devildom has been spied. Kundun expresses his regrets, I'm telling you on his behalf.
Completable_String1=Oh... My legs... It's killing me... Killing me...
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (35/76)<br>I found out the location where Quadro was gone from the branch chief Karon of the Silver sparrowhawk. According to Karon, Quadro seems to have headed to the cave behind the 'Luiziane falls', which is the birthplace of the Drakans species. As I hurriedly to pursue Quadro, I see an injured Detians.

Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (36/76)<br>The Drakans that I ran into at the entrance of Luiziane falls requested I find materials to wrap up his broken leg if I wanted to listen to stories of Quadro.

Name=Location of Drakans village
Occur_String1=Where was I... yes. Prince Ungpam left, taking only the able-bodied Drakans warriors with him. Abandoned us. Then, the king ordered our expulsion. Saying that if we have the tiniest bit of pactra, we were no longer Drakans.
Occur_String2=Ungpam only told us that we'll become healthier by using pactra. Naturally, we accepted it. But we found out only when it was all over. That we were merely test subjects to make stronger soldiers.
Occur_String3=And Quadro reached out to us secretly when we had nowhere else to go. He let us migrate here.
Occur_String4=Why did Quadro care so much for Drakans?
Occur_String5=Beats me. I wouldn't know the mind of big people. We just came here because he promised us our lives. Anyway, I don't know why you're here, but do not talk about Ungpam while you're here.
Occur_String6='Hmm... It seems that Quadro is welcome around these parts. In that case, I shouldn't let on that I'm pursuing Quadro.'<br>I see. I have things to do at Luiziane falls, do you know where it is?

Occur_String2=Oh... Is, is that so? Buh, but, I have work to do here. The research log of prince Ungpam... I can't leave this place until I find it!
Occur_String3=Prince Ungpam broke most of the mechanisms when he left, but some are still operating! If I plug this magic device into them, I'm sure I could get the research logs recorded in the machines.
Occur_String4=If the operation of extracting research logs is not too complicated, I'll do it. This place is too dangerous.<br>Give me the magic devices.
Occur_String5=Thank you! I have prepared a lot of magic devices just in case. It's simple. There should be a socket which matches the plug at the end of this magic device. Just plug it in and wait a bit.
Doing_String=Thu-then, I'll let you be.

Name=The decision
Occur_String1=Now let's get out of here. Or is there anything else you have to do?
Occur_String2=I cuh-can't leave just yet. I have sworn that I'll never leave until I find a way to restore Drakans. My people have to return to the great Vulcan.
Occur_String3=I can understand that, but shouldn't you also think about the people who are waiting for you outside?
Occur_String4=What you say is true... to tell the truth, if I see my family and friends again... I'm afraid I might give it up.
Occur_String5=... Okay. If that's what you've decided, it's not in my place to tell you otherwise. So, I'll wish you luck. I'll try my best to take care of the remaining monsters. But please leave as soon as you can. We don't know what kind of dangers are lurking here.
Occur_String6=Th-thank you very much. I have no words to express my gratitude to you.
Occur_String7=Right, I heard that you have the map which shows the way to Luiziane falls, can you give that to me?
Occur_String8=That map should be at my home. After I found this place, I left it at home. Please tell my wife to check the 4th space in the right side of the cupboard.
Occur_String9=... *Sigh* I've got a headache. All right.
Doing_String=Please tell my wife I'm okay.
Completable_String1=You're back! But, then, where is he?
Completable_String2=He's fine. Healthy. Not a scratch on him. He says there is more stuff to research. Don't worry. Also, now that I've taken care of all the monsters there, he'll be home safe and sound.
Completable_String3=What... The... His only problem is that he's too good. And I'm worried sick here... How could he be like that?
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (42/76)<br>He says that he cannot leave the lab unless he finds the way to restore his people, the mutated Drakans, back to Drakans.

Name=To Luiziane falls once again
Occur_String1=Well... that was the reason I fell in love with him in the first place. For his strong will and personality.
Occur_String2=I don't know what to say... Oh, and there should be a map on the closet 4th on the right. I need it, can you get it for me?
Occur_String3=A... map? Just a sec. I'll look for it.
Occur_String4=Hm, it's here. Are you heading to Luiziane falls?
Occur_String5=I have business there. I'm running late, but it would have taken longer without this map. Then I'll be on my way.<br>Hm... Slap him good when he finally gets back.
Occur_String6=I really should. A slap would really make me feel better. Thank you so much, sir knight. Take care.
Doing_String=How should I hit him? Argg... I feel angry thinking of him.
Completable_String1=*Sigh*... No other way.<br>Kiddo, what's up?
Completable_String2=S-sir knight... *sob*... my duh... my dad has been captured... *bawl*
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (43/76)<br>I delivered the news of her husband and got the map. As I was leaving the village with the map, a crying Drakans kid came to me. His parents were not in sight... I guess there's no other way. Finding the assassin of the king is important, but leaving this kid alone wouldn't make me feel good either.

Occur_String2=The day before yesterday, he said he was going to fish at the stream, then he was captured by the goblins. Please find my father... Will you?

Name=Fortress of goblins
Occur_String1=You look relatively okay. Does this place always have a lot of goblins around?
Occur_String2=No. This fortress was abandoned by Ungpam a while ago. But one day a group of goblins took over the place. We cannot seek help from Drapia, as we are Drakans. We can only form a vigilante and barely stop them.
Occur_String3=Also, these are not common goblins. They can even make their own weapons. They are making them from braziers here and there. Shoddy, but surely better the ones who just picked them. And they're making some use of the fortress as well.
Occur_String4=Something's behind this. I see. I'll take care of the ones nearby, so take your chance and run away with other hostages.<br>I'll also destroy the braziers which makes weapons while I'm at it. Then their threats will lessen for a while.
Doing_String=Thank you, sir knight! Please visit our village later!

Occur_String2=If I get him, I could find out why the goblins came here, and how they knew how to make weapons and use the fortress. Thanks for the valuable info.
Occur_String3=But, the goblins near the boss looked much fiercer. I'm sure sir knight will be fine with the capability to save us, but please take care all the same.

Occur_String2=K... krr... krr...
Occur_String3=So you don't want to talk. You must be really scared of the mastermind.<br>And I'm not as scary. Hm. You're much braver than I thought, aren't you?
Occur_String4=Kuh, krr! I, I'll talk! I'll talk! It was some Drakans! With great magic, krr! He destroyed where we were living. A lot of ice, krrr! Fell down and many bad goblins got hurt. Krr. That Drakans told us to come here.
Occur_String5=Krr, krr. And to stop anyone from passing. Also how to place goblins in the fortress, krr! That Drakans showed us how to use the braziers as well! Krr!
Occur_String6=A magic that makes falling ice. Was this Drakans, somewhat old? With a blunt mouth, and about 4 horns?
Occur_String7=That's right. White horns! Krr! The horns were white! And a fancy armor as well! Krrr! White with gold! White armor!
Occur_String8='So it was Quadro who prepared these goblins. How long ago was he making plans...'<br>All right. It seems you're telling the truth, so I'll keep my word. Go away. Right now. I'll let you go without harming you.
Doing_String=Krrr. We'll leave. Keep, keep your promise!
Completable_String1=Huh? How did you get here? Did you get rid of those goblins? That's great!
Completable_String2=The situation doesn't seem too good. Did the goblins take this place as well?
Completable_String3=No. The goblins never crossed that bridge. They must be very scared.<br>Something more than goblins is the problem.
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (48/76)<br>It seems that Quadro had drawn the goblins as well. To stop the one who will get in his way to come here. He must have been planning for this for a long time. I wrapped up everything around here and crossed the bridge to head to another Drakans village.

Name=Group who harass the same race
Occur_String1=I'm too young to know well, but there were Drakans who followed a Drakans named Ungpam, they made some kind of organization by themselves down there.
Occur_String2=Anyway, those Drakans are wandering about this waterfall as they pleased and harassing other Drakans. Beat them up, and also take the food and things that we gathered by hard work.
Occur_String3=They say, 'pay with goods for keeping things in order'. But, it's bullshit because it's themselves who are breaking the order...
Occur_String4=Sir knight. Can you please return the stuff they took from us? There are carriages all over the place which they're using to move things. You can collect from those.
Occur_String5='An ex-trooper of Ungpam... He may as well know something. Also, I can't just turn my back on this.'<br>All right. By the way, do you know where they came from?

Occur_String2=Um... What kind of favor?
Occur_String3=Oh... Thank you. I don't know if you heard it yet, but those who live over at the mountain camp attacked our village. What on earth would they take from such a small village... they come and wreak havoc, then go.
Occur_String4=Usually we just give them what they want out of fear, but they went too far this time, so my son and some of the other villagers left the village to confront them.
Occur_String5=And the result... It was almost too much to see with my own eyes. They killed the villagers in cold blood and put them up on poles as examples. Beasts wouldn't do such a thing... They did that to their own kind.

Completable_String1=Thank you so much. I feel the souls of my son and villagers are avenged if just a tiny bit.
Completable_String2=Who are they, anyway? They don't seem to be any other rogues wreaking havoc. That kid told me earlier that they are the followers of Ungpam, can you elaborate on that?
Completable_String3=They are the followers of Ungpam, who blended in when Quadro led us here. Although they are not the elites of prince Ungpam, they seem to be stronger than us normal Drakans, probably because they fit well with pactra.
Completable_String4=When we moved here, Quadro separately gathered and consulted them. I suppose he told them, being somewhat strong, they should become vigilantes and protect us. He wouldn't have told them to harass us like this, now would he?
Completable_String5='Rather, he would have told them to kill anyone who crosses over here by any means necessary. Anyhow, I may get some information once I find their captain.'

Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (51/76)<br>They seem to be weaker than the other Drakans who followed Ungpam, but stronger than ordinary Drakans.

Completable_String3=The situation is not good, but all the plunderers have been taken care of. They'll stay away for a while.<br>So now for questions again. Who are you and what are you doing here?

[Quest_5754]
Name=Quadro's actions
Occur_String1=Chairman Quadro came here. And he entered the Drakans' mountain camp in the west. That may be a rare happening, but not altogether a strange one. Because, although not frequently, Quadro visited this place, and the Drakans treat Quadro as if he was their parent.
Occur_String2=But... it was different this time. After chairman Quadro left the mountain camp, the Drakans suddenly started preparing their arms. As if... getting ready for war. Our cleric felt quite uneasy for the whole thing, and told me to report this to the capital urgently.<br>And... Can you tell me what is going on?
Occur_String3=You must not speak of this to anyone. Quadro assassinated the king Kazelhike and fled. With this thing called chaos crystal. By now, Chaisong will be in control of capital Quahanan. The situation is almost at its worst, with the attack of the Nobles' alliance as well.
Occur_String4=Oh, no... Gosh. Great Vulcan. Why would you put us Drakans through such an ordeal... The king... At that Quadro.
Occur_String5=Do you know why Quadro came here? I heard that the holy cave of Drakans is near.
Occur_String6=Well, I... My service to Vulcan hasn't been long, so I don't know about the details. Our cleric is at the crystal rock altar sanctuary site, west of here, and it will be better to consult him.
Occur_String7=And by the way, there are many armed Drakans over there. We had a hard time getting through them without being seen. I'm afraid they will not be friendly. Please take care.
Occur_String8=Don't worry about me, worry about yourselves. Rest up for a bit, then have a safe journey to the capital. When you get to the capital...<br>Yes, mention my name, and say that I've sent you. And tell that directly to Chaisong.
Occur_String9=Yes, I understand. It was a blessing of Vulcan to have met you here. Thank you.
Doing_String=My... What is to become of our Drapia.
Completable_String1=Welcome. It is very rare for an outsider to come here, what is your business?
Completable_String2=I met a Vulcan priest heading to the capital, in my pursuit of Quadro. He told me that you've sent him. I talked with him, and got here.

Name=Leader of the Drakans
Occur_String1=Th-this does not make any sense at all. Why would he commit such a heinous thing?<br>Oh Vulcan, is such disaster truly our fate. This is too hard...
Occur_String2=In the current situation, it seems he headed to the cave of Vulcan at Luiziane falls, so is there anything that has got to do with chaos crystal at that place?
Occur_String3=That is the most sacred place, the birthplace of us Drakans, and there is absolutely no way it has anything to do with that terrible thing called the fragment of Sekneum. Nothing like that. I guarantee you of that.
Occur_String4=Damn... Then why on earth is Quadro there. I'm sure he took the chaos crystal with him because he could put it to use there...
Occur_String5=There is a sacred jewel called 'the noble heart of the dragon king' in the cave of Vulcan. According to Drakans' legends, when Vulcan created new life, the dragon king Kaizel came and presented his own hardened essence. That is 'the noble heart of the dragon king'. Vulcan was touched by it, and created us with the essence of Kaizel.
Occur_String6=If that's the case... I've heard that there is a mountain camp of Drakans working on Quadro's orders near this place. Where is it? And do you know who their leader is?
Occur_String7=It's not far from here. Just a little way to the west. And their leader is a Drakans named 'Belma'.
Occur_String8=I see. He may know something, so I'm going to visit him.
Occur_String9=Will you? But surely you don't think they will talk to you obediently?
Occur_String10=There are many ways of conversing. Including some radical ones.
Doing_String=Hm... I will not question your measure of conversation.
Completable_String1=I wondered who was oppressing us so hard... It was you, %s_9_1. Ungpam's worst enemy, I will chew your flesh! If it wasn't for you, his grand world would already have opened!
Completable_String2=That was the most original modifier that came with my name. But Ungpam gorged on pactra at the hands of demons and became a monster. Could he open a new world after that? I don't think he could even hold the doorknob.
Completable_String3=Lies, no more lies! He didn't become a monster! How could I trust your words! Ungpam and us Drakans lost everything and were driven all the way out here because of you!
Completable_String4=Currently, how Ungpam turned out is not important at all. Anyway, I suppose you don't know what happened, as it's only Ungpam you're concerned with.<br>Hadn't Quadro taken some Drakans troops a while ago? Do you know why he took them?
Completable_String5=I don't. Because I'm sure that he wouldn't do anything without cause!
Completable_String6=Listen carefully. Quadro assassinated the king Kaizelhike and fled. To this very place, the cave of Vulcan.
Completable_String7=What, no... Quadro?
Completable_String8=If Kazelhike was a bad king, that could have been his excuse. But that's not the case is it? Moreover, Quadro joined hands with the Nobles' alliance to ravage territories in Drapia; Quahanan approach is already covered with the blood and flesh of your kind. You haven't fallen too low to rationalize all this as 'sacrifice for the greater good', have you?
Completable_String9=Is this the fabulous 'grand nation'? A nation that thrusts everyone into chaos, and kills those who oppose? That should really work well. Must be a pretty sight. Please let me know when such nation is completed. I'll be watching from a distance with a drink in my hand. Don't they say that the best fun is watching a fight or fire? I'm sure I'll be able to see such in the country that you build.
Completable_String10=.....
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (55/76)<br>As I thought, this leader of Drakans had no idea of what Quadro was up to. They were so blindly absorbed in their faith to Quadro, who was in the same circles in thoughts but also at a higher position and saved them from exile, that they didn't realize they were sinking.
List_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (55/76)<br>The Vulcan cleric also didn't know the reason why Quadro went to the cave of Vulcan. With a sliver of hope, I am going to find the Drakans leader and question him. Of course, he wouldn't just tell me... Which leaves me no choice.

Name=The hidden brother
Occur_String1=I'll say once again. Quadro fled to the cave of Vulcan. What was the reason for that?
Occur_String2=... I don't know. In truth, I didn't know he went to the cave of Vulcan until you'd said it. He ordered us to stop anyone from coming here with our lives. That if this succeeded, the world that we dreamed of shall open.<br>To doubt his words... We received so much, so many from him.
Occur_String3=It's almost like brainwashing. Quadro... He is unbelievably thorough.<br>*Sigh*, anyway, so you don't know either. All ri...
Occur_String4=... Wait.
Occur_String5=Was there anything else?
Occur_String6=Actually, there's this guy who was with Quadro and fled with him. My... brother. I almost killed him by myself out of shame and disappointment, but I hid him, as blood-kin. I told the other Drakans that he was exiled.
Occur_String7=... That's the first good deed of yours until now. And your brother, the most wise of all Drakans.<br>Where is your brother now?
Occur_String8=Do you have a map? I'll mark it.<br>Hm... Here. Not too far. Right under your nose.<br>And I need a favor. I heard that the maniacal followers of Quadro are planning to kill my brother, saying that traitors and cowards should die. If possible, could you stop them?
Occur_String9=Also... Please deliver my message to my brother. Get out of Drapia... No, out of Littenberg. I cannot leave as I have a mission here. But my brother...
Occur_String10=I see. Will do. And that's gonna be the second good deed of yours until now.
Doing_String=I didn't ask for this.
Completable_String1=I didn't know Quadro would go so far as to send an outsider to kill me. Or did my brother finally make up his mind.
Completable_String2=I'm after Quadro. And I took care of the maniacal followers of Quadro who were after you. On your brother's request.
Completable_String3=My brother? ... Then something really must have happened.<br>.....<br>Wait. It wasn't Quadro, who actually assassinated the king? Oh no, I can't believe he actually did. Really...
Completable_String4=All of us Drakans owe a lot to Quadro. I respect him as well, but I couldn't accept that. I ran away because I was scared. Do I look cowardly to you?
Completable_String5=The most honorable thing would be to stand up to what's wrong, but in your situation I believe it takes a lot of courage to not participate in injustice. From my point of view, you're the best among the Drakans.
Completable_String6=Do you know what Quadro is up to? Please tell me if you know.
Completable_String7=Quadro was planning on two things. One was the assassination of the king That was a success. And...
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (56/76)<br>I swept up the fanatic Drakans followers and met the brother of the leader. He knew that Quadro was going to assassinate the king. Then, wouldn't it be natural for him to know what he was planning at the cave of Vulcan?
List_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (56/76)<br>I have to escape from the Drakans' mountain camp, take care of those who are trying to kill the leader's brother, and meet him.
Mission_String=Kill the fanatic Drakans followers, and meet the leader's brother
Mission_Target1=Kill the fanatic Drakans followers

[Quest_5757]
Name=The unimaginable plan
Occur_String1=He said he will be reborn as a new and great being.<br>That he will become the eternal guardian of Drakans and Drakans, and all other races will bow to us.
Occur_String2=... Ha, that's quite a face. All other Drakans there were as ridiculous as you. But everyone was overwhelmed when he took out this strange crystal. It was scary, but he showed that he had a mighty power with him.
Occur_String3=Which was... the chaos crystal.
Occur_String4=Chaos crystal, is that what it's called? The name fits perfectly. Anyway, we all felt the power from that crystal, and believed that Quadro would become a great being as he said.<br>I only ran away because I was more afraid of what would come after.
Occur_String5=That's absurd. I really didn't expect this. Reborn as a new and great being? What does that even mean...
Occur_String6=I don't know if you can stop him or not, but if you're willing to try, you'd better get with the Vulcan priest and cleric at the front of the cave. They are the ones who manage the cave of Vulcan, so they might know more about it.
Occur_String7=I see. I'll do that. Thanks for the information.<br>Right, I also have one more thing to say. Your brother wants you to leave. Leave Littenberg. He said you may still survive if you leave now.
Occur_String8=What? Then, what will become of my brother?
Occur_String9=He said he will take responsibility for his own duties.
Occur_String10=Damn... He's not even going away together. That should really make my way comfortable. Phew..<br>Anyway, thank you too. It's almost like you've saved my life as well. Wish you well.
Doing_String=I told you everything that I know of. Now it's up to you.
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (57/76)<br>The cave of Vulcan was surrounded by dragons and Drakans who were absorbed in an evil aura. They attacked me, spouting an indiscriminative murderous force. This will not be an easy way through.
List_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (57/76)<br>An unimaginable plan came from the mouth of the leader's brother. Quadro said he will become a new and great being, and all species will bow to him. What was all... It was too unrealistic that my mind couldn't catch up with it. Anyway, it wasn't far to the cave of Vulcan. The leader's brother said that the cave of Vulcan was not opened to everyone, and I should ask for help to the clerics in front of the place.
Mission_String=Move to where Quadro is
Mission_Target1=Move to the cave of Vulcan

[Quest_5758]
Name=The ones manipulated by the evil mind
Completable_String1=Thank you, warrior, we were in panic as Drakans and dragons suddenly attacked us as well. It was fortunate that this place had the power of Vulcan.<br>This happened after chairman Quadro passed this place. Well, I thought I could sense a fearsome and frightening aura.
Completable_String2=They say chairman Quadro assassinated the king and fled. We heard the news after he was gone. If we had known, we'd have risked our lives to capture him here...
Completable_String3='The word is getting around already. On the other hand, considering the scope of the incident, maybe it's too slow.'<br>You would have died as well, if you did that. Take it as luck.
Completable_String4=I've come here after Quadro. Did he enter the cave of Vulcan, behind there?
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (58/76)<br>I suppressed the Drakans and dragons contaminated with the evil spirit of Quadro near the cave of Vulcan, and met the clerics who were in charge of the cave of Vulcan. I suppose they couldn't keep the rumors from spreading any longer, as the news of Quadro's assassination of the king reached here. I can only hope Chaisong and other Drakans are keeping Quahanan safe.
List_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (58/76)<br>As I approached the cave of Vulcan, the Drakans and dragons controlled by the evil mind of Quadro stood against me. It may leave problems in the future to let them be.
Mission_String=Defeat the Drakans and dragons controlled by the evil spirit of Quadro
Mission_Target1=Kill the evil Drakans
Mission_Target2=Kill the evil dragons

[Quest_5759]
Name=The qualification to enter
Occur_String1=However, you cannot enter the cave. You are not qualified.
Occur_String2=Really, qualification in this situation?
Occur_String3=Calm down. This is not our decision. It was decided by Vulcan and Kaizel. We don't have a say in what the gods have decided.<br>We cannot enter either, and all we can do is pray here or take care of the surroundings.
Occur_String4=If someone tried to enter without the necessary qualification, he or she would be eliminated by the wrath of god. Oh, so don't try that. I once saw a thief try entering and disappear miserably with my own eyes.
Occur_String5=No other way then. So, what is the qualification, and how can I earn it?
Occur_String6=I'm not sure, but Chaisong may know. Drakan knights are the royal knights, but also the loyal sword of Vulcan as well. I'm sure that Chaisong, the leader, would know of many things. But...
Occur_String7=Just between ourselves, Chaisong is currently imprisoned. He was held for the missing prince. For Chaisong to be imprisoned in such troubled times...
Occur_String8=You knew about the king's assassination, but you're slower for other news. By now, Chaisong would be free and in charge of defending Quahanan. Anyway, I must visit Chaisong then. Thanks.
Doing_String=There will be nothing to fear if Chaisong is defending Quahanan.
Completable_String1=Oh, %s_9_1! Brethren! A great burden has been lifted, thanks to you. The senators, who are always fighting amongst each other, have united in the current crisis. This should have happened much earlier... But now that the king has passed away...<br>The warrior stands alone without his lord. It is shameful.
Completable_String2=Just concentrate on what we have to do now. If you fall now, everything falls. Think of keeping Drapia as a payback for not being able to protect your lord.
Completable_String3=You are absolutely right, brother. I have to get us over this crisis, so that I may have something to say to the king at the side of Vulcan.<br>Anyway... it seems that you're having problems as well? What is it?
Completable_String4=Quadro entered the cave of Vulcan? I tried to follow, but they say you need some kind of qualification to enter, so do you know anything about that?
Completable_String5=Quadro in the cave of Vulcan... Oh no...
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (59/76)<br>I met Chaisong at the palace and asked him about the qualification needed to enter the cave of Vulcan. It would have helped if acquiring it was easy, but I could see this was not the case from his darkened face.
List_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (59/76)<br>I have to meet Chaisong at the palace in order to find out how to get into the cave of Vulcan.
Mission_String=Return to the palace and ask Chaisong about the qualification of the cave of Vulcan
Mission_Target1=Talk with Chaisong

[Quest_5760]
Name=Descendant of the dragon king
Occur_String1=It is said that only the blood descendants of the dragon king Kaizel may enter the cave of Vulcan.
Occur_String2=Quadro is one of the descendants of the dragon king Kaizel. He is also one of the best magicians among us Drakans. That's why he is qualified to enter the cave of Vulcan.
Occur_String3=Then I can't enter anyway? I can't become one of Kaizel's blood now.
Occur_String4=Of course, but that doesn't mean there are no other ways.<br>There is a place called the 'testing ground of admittance' at Luiziane falls. It was built by Kaizel, and he placed a part of his soul in the deepest part there.
Occur_String5=%s_9_1, reach that place and show him of your strength and will directly. Then Kaizel will acknowledge you.
Occur_String6=What has that got to do with anything with blood?
Occur_String7='Anyone who proved oneself at the testing ground of admittance shall be my child' thus, Kaizel said. According to his words, you will qualify to enter the cave of Vulcan.
Occur_String8=Wow... I'm about to have another father.
Doing_String=That reminds me... it's possibly the first time for an outsider to enter the testing ground of admittance.
Completable_String1=I feel the aura of us Drakans from you, only much purer! I say, you are like one of us now!
Completable_String2=I myself have that qualification... but I have to maintain the capital and lead the recapture of Quahanan approach. I'm sorry to put such a heavy burden on you.
Completable_String3=You don't need to be sorry. The important thing is, it's time for everyone to do whatever oneself can.
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (60/76)<br>I felt some kind of a special power permeating into me, when I completed the testing ground of admittance. But I didn't feel repulsion, nor bad. Was this the acknowledgement of the dragon king.<br>Now, I earned the qualification to enter the cave of Vulcan.
List_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (60/76)<br>Kaizel once said that if someone could conquer the place called 'testing ground of admittance', that person will be approved as his child. It seems that only the descendants of Kaizel may enter the cave of Vulcan, I'll have to prove my power and will at the testing ground of admittance.
Mission_String=Prove the power and will at the testing ground of admittance
Mission_Target1=Complete the testing ground of admittance

[Quest_5761]
Name=The greatest warrior of the time
Occur_String1=The second qualification to enter the cave of Vulcan must be 'the greatest warrior of the time'. This is much more straightforward.
Occur_String2=I see. It actually feels better. I would steadily and surely carry on if the situation was different, but I do not have a choice. It's been a while since I drove myself hard.
Doing_String=Who could stand against someone as strong as you... Still, carelessness is the enemy of all warriors, don't forget.
Completable_String1=I feel an incomparable power from brethren! Surely, he is the greatest warrior of the time! Now Vulcan will gladly accept you.
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (61/76)<br>I have become the greatest warrior of the time. Now I have all the qualifications to enter the cave of Vulcan.
List_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (61/76)<br>The second qualification needed to enter the cave of Vulcan is to become the greatest warrior of the time.
Mission_String=Become the greatest warrior of the time
Mission_Target1=Reach level 85

[Quest_5762]
Name=Call of Karon
Occur_String1=By the way, Karon, the silver sparrowhawk, was looking for you. He said it was something about the chaos crystal, but I think it will be better if you heard it directly from him than from myself.
Doing_String=Silver sparrowhawks are, how shall I put it... resourceful fellows.
Completable_String1=You're here. I found out some new clues.
Completable_String2=I have news as well. That Quadro, he... was even more crazy than I thought.
Completable_String3=That's bad news indeed. My news is what happened to Kundun until now, and of the things I found out while researching the Media principality.
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (62/76)<br>So, what could be the new fact that Karon found about the chaos crystal.
List_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (62/76)<br>It seems Karon has found out something new about the chaos crystal. I'll have to see him.
Mission_String=Talk with Karon about the new things he found out
Mission_Target1=Talk with Karon

[Quest_5763]
Name=The new clues
Occur_String1=Have you heard about the chaos crystal from Lemuria?
Occur_String2=She mentioned that the chaos crystal was like a large barrel full of very potent drink. And compared to that, we are like a cupful of water. If one makes a tiny mistake in using it, the balance will crumble, so it is a very hard and difficult thing for us to use. If I remember correctly.
Occur_String3=It's a good comparison. That's right. But there is a way to use it after all. If there was an energy that was as powerful, but the opposite of the chaos crystal, it's said there's a possibility to use it as a tool. To be precise, it's actually using both.
Occur_String4=Hm... Alluding to Lemuria's expression, that will be like drinking the strong drink and the medicine that can neutralize the drink at the same time. In that way, you consume both energies and fuse them. The fortunate thing is, that process will take quite a long time.
Occur_String5=So, you're saying that if the chaos crystal was a kind of energy of darkness, and there was enough power of pure light, that power will be available to use.<br>.....<br>In that case... Would the 'essence of the dragon king Kaizel' be enough?
Occur_String6=The essence of the dragon king Kaizel? Hm... I believe it will be more than enough if it wasn't corrupted....<br>Wait, is that thing in the cave behind the waterfall?
Occur_String7=Right. There seems to be this thing called 'the noble heart of the dragon king'. They say it is the essence of Kaizel which was used in the creation of Drakans, a long time ago. And Quadro is known to be a descendant of Kaizel. If he had such blood, maybe he could use that essence with ease.
Occur_String8=In that case, Kaizel will gain power which nobody on earth has ever had before. Power is a good thing to have, but what is he going to do with that...
Occur_String9=That's what I found out. How he's going to use the power.
Completable_String1=Quadro told his followers that he will become a 'new being'. And that all races will bow to Drakans.<br>I was only awestruck when I heard the tale, but now I understand.
Completable_String2=He wasn't aiming to become a simple king. All this trouble was for him to become a 'god'. They say that a madman with belief is scary, but making such panic with capability and power, no wonder the whole country was rocked.
Completable_String3=No way... If he could absorb both the chaos crystal and the essence of Kaizel, as you've said, he will become a godlike being. Then we will be facing someone who we couldn't disobey.
Completable_String4=All beings in Myu continent will submit to Quadro. Only the will of Quadro will rule us all. The rich and the poor, the nobility and the lowly, no matter the race, will all be equal. Everyone... Will become Quadro's slave.
Completable_String5=We have to stop that. Somehow. No matter what. Whatever it takes.
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (63/76)<br>If Quadro is not stopped, all beings in Myu continent will fall to the position of slaves to him. All will be downtrodden by an absolute being, and even dreams of freedom and resistance will be futile. That must be stopped. Whatever the cost.
List_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (63/76)<br>I felt my blood running cold at Karon's words. Quadro... Literally desired to be god.
Mission_String=Talk about Quadro
Mission_Target1=Talk with Karon

[Quest_5764]
Name=A new crisis
Occur_String1=Brethren! You have gained qualification, but I feel you should hold off heading to the cave of Vulcan.
Occur_String2=Is there anything more important than stopping Quadro? When we don't know how far behind we are, how much of the power has he absorbed?
Occur_String3=Yes. If we don't stop this, the capital will go down in flames.
Occur_String4=... What on earth is going on?
Occur_String5=Epiaros, the guardian dragon who has been asleep at the crystal rock altar, has awakened. But something has gone wrong, as he has gone berserk, and is threating the area of the crystal rock altar and Luiziane falls.
Completable_String1=The crystal rock altar is one of the Drakans' sanctuaries at Luiziane falls. A long time ago, until the Walkreeger empire, it is recorded as the place where Vulcan gave oracle. But Vulcan's words stopped when the empire fell.
Completable_String2=Epiaros volunteered to become the guardian dragon with only one thing in his mind, to protect the altar. He turned away all the trespassers with wrongful mind, and thanks to him, we could safekeep the only place where we can listen to Vulcan's words.
Completable_String3=Now that guardian dragon is smashing what he's supposed to guard, and it's only a matter of time for Drapia kingdom to fall into disaster.<br>And the villain is...
Completable_String4=Quadro. It must be him. I can't forgive that. Such a man used to be the chairman!
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (64/76)<br>Chaisong seemed quite fatigued as he talked about Epiaros, not like the namesake of the leader of the Drakan knights. It was only natural, as the prince has gone missing and the king was assassinated by the chairman. On top of that, the Nobles' alliance is threatening the capital, and a strange dragon named Epiaros was making trouble behind.<br>It was only with his will of steel that Chaisong could hold on, and Drapia may have fallen already if it wasn't for him.
List_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (64/76)<br>So where was this crystal rock altar and who was this Epiaros. I can't believe things are going this way. First, find out the details
Mission_String=Ask about Epiaros
Mission_Target1=Talk with Chaisong

[Quest_5765]
Name=The confused guardian dragon
Occur_String1=Quadro harmed Epiaros using the power of Sekneum which was in the chaos crystal to stop the fierce chase of yours. That's why he lost reason and went berserk.
Occur_String2=If Epiaros comes out, that will be a terrible disaster for us. For now, we have no power to stop him.
Occur_String3=Damn... I heard that the chaos crystal was hard to handle, so is Quadro that good or was the information wrong. There is no good news at all.
Occur_String4=Brethren. Could you stop Epiaros? I'm ashamed to say that we have our hands full just to maintain our current state.
Occur_String5=The chairman of the Senate assassinated the king and the prince is missing. On top of that, the Nobles' alliance is attacking. It's a wonder you're holding up.<br>I'll stop that guardian dragon, while you do your best to keep things in order as before.
Occur_String6=I understand, brethren! It's good to have you on our side! Thank you so much!
Doing_String=Quadro... How could he use the chaos crystal well enough to make Epiaros berserk...
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (65/76)<br>With the qualification to enter the cave of Vulcan, Quadro drove the guardian dragon of Vulcan, Epiaros, crazy with the chaos crystal to stop me from getting in his way. Epiaros, who used to calmly guard the altar of Vulcan, lost his sense by the power of the demon god Sekneum, his opposing force, and has become berserk and a great danger to the kingdom. To stop such rampage of Epiaros, Chaisong asked me to go to the crystal rock altar.
List_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (65/76)<br>On Chaisong's request, I will have to enter the crystal rock altar and calm down the Vulcan's guardian dragon Epiaros.

Name=Epiaros, guardian dragon of the altar
Completable_String1=I'm sorry you had to see me like that. I didn't know that the descendant of the dragon king Kaizel would be a renegade. That terrible chaos crystal has dirtied me.<br>Thank you, stranger. What is your name?
Completable_String2=It's %s_9_1. No need to thank me. Now you look like yourself. It was really close. That was fortunate.
Completable_String3=But... The power of the demon god is still weighing me down. Any time I may turn again....<br>Thank you for making time for me to make the final preparation. Now I may return to Vulcan's side myself.
Completable_String4=Final? You sound like a dying dragon.
Completable_String5=The power of the demon god is carved too deep within my mind and it's tormenting me. I cannot hold down the throbbing rage and desire within myself any longer. I don't know how long I can continue this dialogue...
Completable_String6=... Try to hold on. I know of someone who is very experienced in such matters. He'll find a way.
Completable_String7=Such a small being as you...<br>No. I was thoughtless. I will believe you, who saved me. I'll... trust you.
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (67/76)<br>I enter the crystal rock altar, blast through the guardian stone and guardian spirits protecting the altar, and face Epiaros.

[Quest_5769]
Name=Boonchyamet
Occur_String1=The sealed blaze dragon Valtheram is awakening at the dormant volcano area of Noria, Boonchyamet. If Valtheram wakes up completely, Noria may be gone forever from the maps.
Occur_String2=Boonchyamet is the sealing ground of the blaze dragon Valtheram, who was sealed for worshipping the demon god Sekneum. Lava swarmed the place with the influence of Valtheram, but it became dormant after many years.
Occur_String3=Why should it erupt now... I don't suppose, is this because of Quadro, too? For the chaos crystal that he has? But there's no way he could have got as far as Noria!
Occur_String4=That's right, but I suppose the problem is Valtheram's will. He felt the power of his master, and woke up to run wild. If Valtheram's seal is undone, we have to deal with all the suppressed anger.
Occur_String5=In that case, Quadro wasn't expecting this. But it's advantageous for him. Talk about a sleeper's net catching a fish, he's the sleeper and we're the fish.
Occur_String6=I'll go to Boonchyamet and stop Valtheram. I suppose Noira is not in a situation to move fairies or Axas.<br>I also have to ask a favor.
Occur_String7=A favor, from %s_9_1? Whatever, just name it. Whatever that I'm capable of, or if it isn't, I'll get it to Kundun and have it done.
Occur_String8=There's this ancient dragon named Epiaros at the crystal rock altar, who went berserk by Quadro's trick. I stopped him so it's all right now, but it seems the magic aura from the chaos crystal has infiltrated deep into his mind. So he's like a ticking time-bomb.
Occur_String9=And you want me to eliminate the magic aura and restore him. I see. I will surely find a way.
Occur_String10=All right. Then I'll go to Boonchyamet right now. Chaisong also knows about Epiaros, so contact him if things get tough.
Doing_String=Epiaros... If an ancient dragon stood on our side, that would be of great help.
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (69/76)<br>I arrived at Boonchyamet at the east of Nungchentiang forest in order to stop Valtheram. The excessive heat and magic aura was almost suffocating.

Occur_String2=Originally, Quadro must have planned to absorb the chaos crystal with the power of the noble heart of the dragon king directly at the cave of Vulcan. But when %s_9_1 traced Quadro unexpectedly fast, he must have reached out his evil hands to Epiaros, which was not a part of the plan.

Occur_String2=Kundun will take charge of the chaos crystal. It will be strange for us, as Drakans do not know of this.<br>The prince has the same notion, so I hope you could inform this to Karon, who is staying at the Qahanaan branch of Silver sparrowhawks.
Occur_String3=I see. I'll do that. Excellent choice.
Occur_String4=Oh, and I heard that you were concerned about Epiaros as well. Thank you very much. If Epiaros becomes our reliable protector, Drapia will recover its strength in no time.

Completable_String1=You have stopped Quadro! Such greatness! I don't know how many times %s_9_1 has saved this world.
Completable_String2=It was quite close. If he was let loose, I can't imagine what Quadro would have turned out to be. Right, and Drapia wants you to take care of the chaos crystal. Because you're the best people in all of Myu continent to handle such things.
Completable_String3=Is that so? That must have been a hard decision for the proud Drakans race to make.
Completable_String4=Prince Briant seemed to know the current situation very well. I thought he was somewhat weak, but he's quite wise. Anyhow, was there news from Kundun? About Epiaros, or any other thing.
Completable_String5=He'll be here himself soon. He said he got an idea how to take care of the magic aura as well. I think we can rest at ease.
Completable_String6=That's good. I hope Epiaros will hold on until then.
Complete_String=(Drapia kingdom main quest) (76/76)<br>I successfully crushed Quadro's plot. The ending of the one with twisted faith was miserable. He would have liked to become an eternal being, claiming a great Drakans, but he will go down in history as the traitor who assassinated the king in arrogance. It is really an extreme fall.

Occur_String3=Fun? Yeah, right. *Chuckle* Anyway, I can't tell what it is, but I think there's more to it than meets the eye.<br>But if it belongs to Cerberus, the hero who saved Earth once, it can't be harmful. What happened in Karolsandria is peculiar.
Occur_String4=If this necklace has yet another secret, I don't know if I want to know.
Occur_String5=I'll look further into it. But a lot of records about Cerberus were destroyed during the War. It might take a while. Is that okay?
Occur_String6=I don't care. In fact, I could use some time to train. I feel like I can grow stronger a little bit.

Occur_String2=Huh? Why? I can't imagine her being mean to anyone.
Occur_String3=Ah... No. Anyway, she said this necklace is sealed... What is she talking about?
Occur_String4=According to Grandfather's journal, the necklace has a great power. During the Three-year War, he was able to defeat the Pandemonium Army with the aid of the necklace. That's why I came here to tell you about it. I hoped it would ease your burden...
Occur_String5=(The power of Cerberus, the hero of the Three-year War. If I can use that power...) <br>Such awesome power would definitely be a big help. The queen said we need some gems to break the seal. Did the journal say anything about that?

Complete_String=The destructive powers of the gods that wiped out the mutant den were strong enough to destroy even the most powerful creature on Earth in the blink of an eye.<br>To overcome such undiscriminating power, I must grow stronger.<br>I thought about various ways, and remembered the Hall of Light, the combat-skill training center in Ohrdor.

Name=Looking for a New Power
Occur_String1=I don't want to hear that. I need to grow stronger than I am now.<br>As far as I know, this is the only place that can help me.
Occur_String2=...<br>You've already reached your limits.<br>You can't grow any stronger. Not by conventional methods, anyway.
Occur_String3=...<br>Are there unconventional methods, then?
Occur_String4=...<br>Maybe there is one. The only way you can grow any stronger than you are now is to transcend your past and present and be reborn as a whole new being.
Occur_String5=...A whole new being?
Occur_String6=Yes.<br>But I've never seen it for myself. I'm not sure if it really can be done.
Occur_String7=I learned of this through the mind of an elven knight.<br>There's an elf on the MU continent who has lived longer than any other creature on Earth.
Occur_String8=....!?
Occur_String9=If there really is truth to this, I think he's the one who'd know.<br>He might give you a clue as to the power you're looking for.
Occur_String10=I've heard this elf manages the national library of the elven kingdom, Noria.<br>Why don't you go meet him?

Occur_String3=Rumor has it he's lived longer than anyone and anything else on Earth.<br>I want to know if that's true.
Occur_String4=...<br>Mm, I see.<br>I think I know what you're looking for.
Occur_String5=...<br>But I don't know everything about this person.<br>I suggest you talk to our Head Librarian.
Occur_String6=This reminds me, a while ago, the Head Librarian looked outside and said we'd have a guest soon.<br>I wonder if that would be you...

Occur_String2=Are you Elrond?<br>I've been told you might know this elf I'm looking for.
Occur_String3=Ah, I think I know who you're talking about.<br>He's existed since the beginning of this world, or perhaps even before that.
Occur_String4=...So, you know. Then, I'd like you to tell me about him.
Occur_String5=%s_9_1, I'd love to help you.<br>But... this is not a lecture room, but a library. The oldest one on Earth, at that.<br>In here, you can't expect others to teach the knowledge you're seeking. You have to find it on your own.
Occur_String6=Take however much time you need.<br>I think there are some materials related to what you're looking for in this office. You should find and read them.
Occur_String7=.....
Occur_String8=
Doing_String=In my office, I have three tomes containing the unknown history of Earth.<br>What you're looking for must be in one of them.

Completable_String3=Good, I see you're shrewd enough for us to have this talk.
Complete_String=The Sapientia Library's Head Librarian Elrond mentioned a being who had existed since the creation of this world, and asked me to read about it.<br>I pored over the three old tomes in Elrond's office and found out that this immortal had existed since the Age of the Creator.<br>...And he was Head Librarian Elrond himself.

Occur_String1=Now we can get down to business.
Occur_String2=I need to become stronger than I am now.<br>But I was told that I've reached my limits already.<br>Is there any way I could use your power of immortality to achieve my goal?
Occur_String3=Alright. This, what you see now, isn't how I looked in the beginning.
Occur_String4=The only way to live past our natural life on this Earth... is to become reborn into a different being. This is the power I've received from the Creator: the power of Rebirth.
Occur_String5=Rebirth?
Occur_String6=Yes. I have the ability to be reborn every time my current body becomes too old and frail to keep on living.
Occur_String7=This ability has only been granted to me. Now, the time has come to pass it on, and you shall be the first to learn it.
Occur_String8=...<br>Wait, that's... Wouldn't that affect the causality of this world?<br>What if it weakens, or worse, cancels out your power of immortality?
Occur_String9=Ah, you're as perceptive as I thought. You're right to be concerned.<br>Nevertheless, I still want to grant you this ability, because Earth is under threat from a great power...<br>Namely, the leaders of the Heavens.

Completable_String1=My ability was granted to me by the Creator, who perished a long time ago.<br>To the current leaders of the Heavens, it's something that challenges their legitimacy.

Completable_String3=But lately, they've been making moves here and there on Earth.<br>I'm sure you've recently encountered them, too.
Completable_String4=.....
Completable_String5=If they stay on Earth, sooner or later they'll take notice of me and what I can do, and try to get rid of me to maintain their legitimacy.
Completable_String6=That's why I need help to resist them, and who can help me better than you?

Occur_String2=But there's something I want to know first.<br>According to you, you abandoned who you were to become someone else.
Occur_String3=Is it possible to acquire the power of rebirth without giving up my current shape and form?
Occur_String4=...<br>The purpose of rebirth is to extend one's life.<br>If your body is still full of life, you don't have to replace it.
Occur_String5=This is a more difficult path, but it enables you to only undergo spiritual rebirth by absorbing the powers of other souls.<br>For that, you need to collect the Karma of powerful beings.
Occur_String6=Karma?
Occur_String7=It's the energy of causality that every creature accumulates as they go through cycles of life.<br>The more powerful the creature is, the more Karma it gains.

Name=(T) The suspicious call of Arche
Occur_String1=Hey! Come here for a sec. I have some important matters to tell you.
Occur_String2=I'm busy... what is it?
Occur_String3=Recently, the time-space flow is very unstable. I'm sure you're aware of it, being a time-space traveler yourself?
Occur_String4=..
Occur_String5=Hahaha! Maybe I didn't bother as I'm free from the time-space distortion. But Arche, who is not affected by the time-space distortion like myself, should be aware that the time-space flow is very unstable.
Occur_String6=So I invested where it started, and it turns out to be the crack of time-space in the Garden of Fabris.
Occur_String7=But isn't it strange? The Garden of Fabris where the power of god remains should be much more stable than anywhere else.
Occur_String8=Please find out if there are any problems in the Garden of Fabris. This is an important matter; I hope you'll get to it.
Doing_String=There are not many whom I trust enough for such a task. So please get to the bottom of it.

Name=(T) The unexpected invader
Occur_String1=The Garden of Fabris has been invaded by the golden-mane Gnolls. All the frogs there have run away.
Occur_String2=Golden-mane Gnolls took over the Garden of Fabris? Is that why the time-space flow has been so unstable?
Occur_String3=The Garden of Fabris is a vestige left in the crack of time-space by Fabris, god of manufacture. It is a sacred space that the lowly, golden-mane Gnolls never could have found, let alone invade. If it wasn't through pure luck that they found it in their search for food...
Occur_String4=If we should be suspicious, someone must have opened the crack of time-space to golden-mane Gnolls, which leads to the Garden of Fabris. This is a serious matter. It is hard to believe, but someone has interfered with the timeline of dimension.
Occur_String5=It's a rash assumption, but we must find out if there was one. The quickest way would be to find out if the golden-mane Gnolls who invaded the Garden of Fabris are simple Duelden's Gnolls, or if they came over the dimension through the crack of time-space.
Occur_String6=Please head on to the Garden of Fabris and collect the mane of golden-mane Gnolls, and I'll do the comparative analysis.

Occur_String3=I know it's hard, but I need you for this to conduct the comparative analysis. In the meantime, I'll be working on the Gnoll manes that you collected.
Doing_String=Looking at these manes, it seems the Gnolls have invaded the Garden of Fabris not so long ago. It is not fully permeated with the time-space there. So, it won't be hard to find out.

Name=(T) Runaway frog
Occur_String1=It didn't take long because I had the research records of golden-mane Gnolls.
Occur_String2=By comparing them, I found out that the only difference was the pollution level of time-space; they are the same species. I couldn't find any trace that they traveled across dimensions through the time-space warp.
Occur_String3=I don't understand. How do you know if they traveled across dimensions through the time-space warp?
Occur_String4=I was making something which cracks if the time-space energy of dimension didn't match, just in case. It's not completed yet... I'm a little baffled because the timeline problem of dimension occurred too early.
Occur_String5=Anyway, it seems that the recent unstable time-space flow wasn't a matter of the Garden of Fabris. I suppose it was by pure luck that golden-mane Gnolls happened upon the Garden of Fabris while searching for food.
Occur_String6=No... It's suspicious...<br>From your research, it's strange that the croakers are scared and all the frogs have run away. Croakers are a very special kind of frogs. Especially, their song has an effect which encourages frogs.
Occur_String7=Please find the runaway frogs. I have to investigate the reason why they ran away from the Garden of Fabris, and check if that is relevant with the dimension's timeline.

Occur_String3=What kind of feeling is that? Please be specific.
Occur_String4=I'm not so sure. It's just a feeling.<br>Ah! It's a little different from what I feel from the Archeans of the Rift Researchers.
Occur_String5=Hm... it sounds like that you're feeling the distortion of time-space. And if you say it is different from mine, that means I have reached the level which they couldn't.
Occur_String6=For instance, experiencing a different dimension through the time-space warp. What you say is unclear, but I cannot let go of the fact that you sensed the same feeling from those frogs as from myself.
Occur_String7=Please go to the time-space warp once again and collect the time-space energy accumulated in the body of those frogs. Calculating the time those frogs ran away, the time-space energy must be crystallizing and piling up in their bodies.

Occur_String1=I couldn't find anything out of the ordinary from the time-space crystals you got. I suspect that someone has tampered with the timeline of dimension, but I don't have the proof.
Occur_String2=Is my hunch off?
Occur_String3=Not necessarily. Estimating the period from when the frogs ran away from the Garden of Fabris and now, the time-space pollution rate is way too high. I will need to investigate further regarding this matter.
Occur_String4=It's hard. The timeline of dimension... and investigating the unstable time-space flow from there...
Occur_String5=All these would have happened eventually. I'm just a little confused because it happened too early.
Occur_String6=Don't worry too much. Recently the time-space flow has become very unstable, and I suspect a foul-play on the timeline of dimension from researching that flow. And that's why we're looking for the proof of that...
Occur_String7=Now, we have to investigate the secret safe, hidden in the time-space warp by Luery. Because that is where the time-space flow similar to the one in the Garden of Fabris was found. If we keep on investigating, we are bound to find something.

Occur_String1=How was the secret safe? I wonder if the Goblin rebellion has not been suppressed yet.
Occur_String2=Right. The safe was in a terrible state, as the rebellion hasn't been suppressed. Look for the details in the investigation report.
Occur_String3=Hm... I thought there may be some changes considering the unstable flow of time-space, but there seems to be not much difference. <br>No... wait! You say that the rebellion leader is Warblin the cannibal? It seems there is a problem.
Occur_String4=I guess it is time to share everything. In this world that we live in, there are many coexisting dimensions. Each dimension changes subtly change due to trivial incidents or environments, but there are common facts which are constant.
Occur_String5=Those facts are bound by the timeline of dimension, which maintains our world. The ancient pioneers crossed over dimensions through time-space warps and recorded the incidents bound by this timeline, and those are stored in the library hidden within the time-space warp.
Occur_String6=One of the records in the library is the rebellion of the secret safe. It seems to be a trivial incident, but this rebellion of the secret safe caused changes to Luery and leads to a major influence on the Rift Research Society in the future.
Occur_String7=But from your report, the leader of the rebellion has changed to Warblin the cannibal. I think someone is trying to distort the timeline of dimension by causing a tiny change. The Garden of Fabris also seems to be an intervention in the timeline of dimension by a similar method...
Occur_String8=Firstly, we should investigate if the intervention in the timeline of dimension caused the change of the leader in the secret safe rebellion. Please check what happened by finding Warblin who was guarding the secret safe.

Occur_String2=Oh no... it seems that the timeline of dimension interference is not solely our dimension's problem. I cannot correctly estimate the scope of their evil plot.
Occur_String3=So it's known. And who were those that tampered with the timeline of dimension?
Occur_String4=To be honest, I cannot reveal their true identity. You have to find out by yourself. If I speak of them, it may endanger you as well as myself.
Occur_String5=As you have said, I am close to guessing who intervened with the timeline of dimension. I requested help because I needed to be sure. I tried to guide the Rift Researchers to the Liberator's hideout to fix the corrupted timeline.
Occur_String6=But that space is not quite what I expected. It's distorted so much; I cannot do anything... All I can do now is to put my trust in the Rift Researchers and wait. For the researchers to approach the timeline of dimension by themselves...

Occur_String2=If I have that one in your hand, and buy the last one, the luxury brooch will be exclusively mine. Then the price will skyrocket, right? How about it? I'll share the profit with you, so make me an offer: think of it as an investment!
Occur_String3=I'm sorry. That is not why I got this brooch for you. I got this from a creature which was possibly a mutated form of you, in a recently found time-space warp.
Occur_String4=Really? So Grande's research wasn't all BS. The mutated creature must have been myself in another dimension. I guess Luery from that dimension was mutated because she foolishly couldn't control time-space energy.
Occur_String5=Until now, Grande's research wasn't credited due to the lack of evidence for his theory... Could you elaborate about the newly found time-space warp?
Occur_String6=It is a space full of mutated creatures, a time-space warp called the Liberator's hideout. As there was more than one mutated Luery, it seems many dimensions are getting mixed up and distorted.<br>Now that I think of it, all of them had the same badge as you.
Occur_String7=This badge represents a time-space researcher. All of them have mutated because they were too stupid to control the time-space distortion, and it's full of such mutants... that's so fantastic!
Occur_String8=Help! This is a great business model. Firstly, please go to the newly found time-space warp and find these badges for the mutants. It's precious because they're made of nuk which have high purity through repeated refinement.
Occur_String9=..<br>The response is quite different from what suspicious Arche said.

Name=(T) Call of Mercler
Occur_String1=Hey! You're on an errand from Luery? If my guess is right, it must be something related to the time-space of another dimension...
Occur_String2=Right. I have been to the time-space warp found by the old Arche from the workshop in Ohrdor. I heard that the space is a mixture of many dimensions.
Occur_String3=Old man Arche call the place as the Depraved liberator's hideout. If I told Luery she would investigate the place and prepare for what will come of it... To no avail.
Occur_String4=Liberator's hideout?<br>If old man Arche said that, it must mean that someone is interfering with the timeline of dimension? It seems the time has come.
Occur_String5=What? You seem surprised that I'm talking so much about the timeline of dimension? Don't be. I, Mercler, is the only one of the Rift Research Society who has reached the library hidden in the time-space warp. That's how I know.
Occur_String6=Seems like it's time for me to make a move. Please tell me what is going on, and the things you have found out at the Liberator's hideout. I have to know my place... or what do I have to investigate and prepare for.

Name=(T) Search for Barchenrhode
Occur_String1=Hm... Why was Luery's letter found at the Depraved liberator's hideout? The letter says that she has locked herself and Benti in the labyrinth.
Occur_String2=That's what I thought strange as well! You're quite clever, aren't you? From the records in the library, the Liberator's hideout was where the researchers of the Rift Research Society from each dimension got together. But it seems that the continuous interference twisted the timeline and dimensions got mixed up.
Occur_String3=As a result, the researchers couldn't control time-space energy, causing mutation. If I keep on investing the Liberator's hideout, I'll face the same fate as well. It's dangerous anyway, full of mutants...
Occur_String4=I think that the incident with the letter was the result of someone interfering with the timeline of dimension as well. So if I follow up on how the letter ended up in the Liberator's hideout, I think I'll get to the bottom of who was fiddling with the timeline. Let's start with investigating the labyrinth.
Occur_String5=There is a time-space predator named Barchenrhode in the labyrinth. According to the library's records, he lost everything in a day to the ancient frost dragon, and found his way into the labyrinth seeking revenge.
Occur_String6=But strangely, this is the only part where the records match; what he lost differs in all of them. I myself found out that he lost his realm... Some say it lost his lover.
Occur_String7=How can library records be so mixed up... isn't it suspicious? It's almost as if some being that interfered with the timeline is blocking me out. That's why I think there is a secret concerning Barchenrhode.
Occur_String8=I am going to lure Barchenrhode and find out how he ended up in the labyrinth. If I keep on researching, wouldn't I find out which record was true, and who interfered with the timeline?
Occur_String9=Of the muzzy records, one thing remains the same: he holds a grudge against the ancient frost dragon. I'm going to use that to call him out from the vast labyrinth. It will be easy if I use the coldness of the ancient frost dragon.
Occur_String10=First, I need a container which can hold the coldness of the ancient frost dragon. The heart of ice dragon in the time-space warp of Littenberg should do the trick. Surely, you know it's going to take more than one, right?
Doing_String=I'll need a lot of dragon hearts to make a sturdy one. So get me as many as you can!
Completable_String1=That's great! We have enough dragon hearts to hold the coldness of the ancient frost dragon!
Complete_String=(Labyrinth group quest) (2/11)<br>Mercler begins the investigation to find out who is interfering with the timeline of dimension. He takes a hint from Luery's letter and the library, and is sure he can find out by investigating Barchenrhode, the predator in the labyrinth.

Occur_String1=The container is almost done, thanks to you. Now we need to fill this with coldness that is level with that of the ancient frost dragon.
Occur_String2=The ancient frost dragon has existed since ancient times, but nobody has actually seen it. Because they all froze to death. It's said that the sole survivor is Barchenrhode!
Occur_String3=Such is the coldness that the ancient frost dragon has. To imitate such force, we need coldness crystals that are in the league of yetis lurking in Littenberg. A lot of it, too!
Occur_String4=I will extract the coldness from these crystals and put them into the container made of ice dragon hearts. If all goes as planned, I'm sure we could closely imitate the coldness of the ancient frost dragon.
Occur_String5=So please fetch the coldness crystals from yetis lurking in the time-space warp!

Occur_String3=Now please investigate how Barchenrhode ended up in the labyrinth.
Occur_String4=Hm... I'm worried that too much time has passed since Barchenrhode got into the labyrinth. If insanity overcame him and he became the predator of the labyrinth, it's likely he has lost his sanity.
Occur_String5=If that's the case, please investigate the body of Barchenrhode thoroughly and find out the reason he came to the labyrinth. There may be some records, like a journal or diary!
Doing_String=The labyrinth is big. It may take you more than one attempt, but please don't give up and keep searching. I'm sure that the ancient frost dragon's coldness will lure out Barchenrhode eventually...

Name=(T) Margerine Gracia
Occur_String1=There was nothing about the timeline of dimension in the journal of Barchenrhode that you found.
Occur_String2=Is that so? Was it all for nothing... <br>No results from the very first investigation...
Occur_String3=Don't let yourself down. Still, the journal held some details of the reason Barchenrhode held a grudge against the ancient frost dragon and how he came to the labyrinth.
Occur_String4=According to the journal, everything in the city under the reign of Barchenrhode froze over when the ancient frost dragon merely flew over the place. Barchenrhode set out to revenge the ancient frost dragon but couldn't find it and ended up in the labyrinth.
Occur_String5=Luckily, there is a book in the library which says the same thing. Which means that it is a reliable book in the midst of the confusion of records of the labyrinth caused by the interference of timeline. So I looked up, and there was one person who caught my attention.
Occur_String6=It is a swordswoman who was dubbed the best in the whole Myu continent, named Margerine. There are many records as she was so famous 400 years ago, but I was curious that there are none about her latter days, and I found out that she became a predator of the labyrinth in her pursuit of mastership.
Occur_String7=You know him too, right? Adrian, the leader of the Nobles' alliance... she was an ancestor of that stiff-necked house. I guess they tried their best to cover up the records of her latter days because they were ashamed of the fact that she couldn't keep her pride as a noble and became the predator of the labyrinth.
Occur_String8=From my scope of knowledge as well, Margerine is referred to only in this book. So now we're going to investigate Margerine, that's the best chance we have. First, find the noble of the house of Adrian hiding out in the blood-ice mountain and ask about the hidden records of Margerine.
Occur_String9=I'm sure the labyrinth is related to the timeline of dimension. It will take a long time as we have to investigate without solid evidence, but we will eventually find a clue relating to the timeline of dimension. So, don't give up!
Doing_String=Adrian's rebellion failed, but the family's base is still within the blood-ice mountain. Search the place thoroughly and you'll find someone related to the house of Adrian.

Occur_String5=The place of records? Where is it?
Occur_String6=You can see that at the Sapientia library with the crest of the Gracia family, which is held by Divaline, the head of the family. As we are currently being pursued by the Lorensia kingdom, we can't afford to store such records.
Occur_String7=In case of histOrikal records such as Margerine, the Sapientia library is making an exception. Now that things have come to this, take care of the soldiers of Gracia family along with Divaline.

Name=(T) The witch's trick
Occur_String1=Interesting. I was about to investigate Pamella if we couldn't find a clue about the being who interfered with the timeline of dimension by researching Margerine. And their relation goes way deep...
Occur_String2=Pamella's name came up most frequently as I was researching the records of labyrinth to learn about the interference to the timeline of dimension. She is a witch who acquired eternal life by alchemy, and she's a real crazy woman.
Occur_String3=Pamella had almost too much time after she had eternal life. That's why she grew a bad taste, and entrapped people by maneuvering their desires.
Occur_String4=It was the same with Margerine. As it was difficult to become the best at swords in the Myu continent due to her gender, she made her believe that there was a relic hidden in the labyrinth to overcome the obstacle, and as a result, Margerine never made it out of the labyrinth.
Occur_String5=That's what we know... No, that's what we may know if we have read the records of Gracia family. I guess the only way to solve the secret lies in the labyrinth. Find the wandering Margerine in the labyrinth and find out the truth.
Occur_String6=If there was interference to the timeline of dimension, it's likely that the reason for Margerine to head into the labyrinth may have differed. Please find something that can continue our investigation, such as the journal of Barchenrhode. I don't mind if it's about Pamella.
Occur_String7=It's all connected, from the records of the library to the appearance of Pamella. I'm sure we have found the trace of the being who interfered with the timeline of dimension this time.

[Quest_202537]
Name=(T) The Manager
Occur_String1=That's quite an achievement. We only wanted to find out the reason why Margerine ended up wandering the labyrinth and to see if it matches the records found from the library, and you hit the jackpot. What you got from Margerine is the document on the labyrinth.
Occur_String2=I suppose she kept those records in hopes of someone finding them. Amazingly, two persons helped make this document. Margerine is one, and the other is Benti. What a surprise! It seems that Benti from the other dimension wasn't so stupid.
Occur_String3=According to this document, the abandoned Benti researched the labyrinth for a long time. In fact, it seems that he was already investing the being who interfered with the timeline of dimension from before. And he was pretty close to that someone. The almighty of the dimension, called the Manager...
Occur_String4=The Manager felt pressure and intervened with the timeline of dimension to get rid of Benti, and that intervention was none other than Luery's action. It seems Benti hadn't given up his investigation even after being abandoned in the labyrinth, and ran into many predators of the labyrinth on his way.
Occur_String5=And what he found out was that the labyrinth was a kind of prison where the Manager kept prisoners who were a nuisance, like himself. So, he unveiled the secret of the Manager and the labyrinth, but Benti didn't have much time left. He was being eaten by insanity.
Occur_String6=That was when he met Margerine, who had just entered the labyrinth. That's how Margerine succeeded his research. Actually, the time is not right for Benti to meet Margerine. Margerine lived 400 years ago, and Benti is an Archean of our time.
Occur_String7=Maybe that's the uniqueness of the labyrinth? Or was it caused by continuous interference by the Manager? Anyway, what actually happened, not to the likes of the Manager, was that Benti got into the Liberator's hideout and we found out about the Manager who manages time-space.
Occur_String8=I'm guessing that continuous interference, not just once or twice, caused a distortion in the timeline and incidents like Benti kept going on, and it ran out of control because the interference kept piling up to cover it up again and again?
Occur_String9=After Margerine succeeded Benti's records, she found out that Pamella could travel across dimensions with the help of an item. Was Pamella connected to the Manager? If so, why did Pamella end up being a predator of the labyrinth?
Occur_String10=If we keep on researching Pamella, I believe we can get closer to the Manger. We don't know the true nature, but maybe we'll get a clue on why the Manger is messing with time-space and dimensions by interfering with the timeline...
Doing_String=Maybe the reason we found out about the Manger was the result of distortion of the timeline as well? I suppose the Manager didn't want things to get out of hand like this.

Name=(T) The Enforcer
Occur_String1=You have found the chalk from Pamella? It seems this chalk is the item Margerine mentioned. But how could someone travel across dimensions at will when I cannot sense any force from it?
Occur_String2=According to the records of the labyrinth, Pamella tricked people into it. But deducing from what we found out from our investigation, this wasn't just some sick prank, but it looks like it was done on the Manager's orders.
Occur_String3=She entrapped the ones being a nuisance to the Manager in the labyrinth and tried to go to another dimension with the chalk but was trapped in it as the chalk ran out of its power.
Occur_String4=Pamella was a minion of the Manager... kind of an Enforcer.  But in the end, she was left on her own by the Manager, as she ended up in the labyrinth herself.
Occur_String5=Please let the old Arche know of finding the chalk, and what we have found out so far. We haven't got to revealing the true identity yet, but it seems to be our job to stop the Manager and Enforcers following his orders.

Occur_String2=I suppose it was with your help, who is free from the distortion of time-space, that he got so close to the truth in such short time? But the real fight is just starting. Also, the time for me to step up is closing...
Occur_String3=I'll have to give a present to the Rift Research Society to prepare for the future. This chalk that you have mentioned.
Occur_String4=A chalk is a kind of a thing naturally made by accumulated time-space energy, and you can get enough energy to travel across dimensions when the accumulated force explodes by using it.
Occur_String5=It is not one of Manager's objects, but the Manger knows of this better than anyone else. Get this and take it to Mercler of the Rift Research Society. It will be of a great help to them in the future...
Occur_String6=You can get the chalk from the Liberators' haven. Liberators used it a lot before becoming corrupted...
Doing_String=Get as much as you can. I suppose Mercler has started to research the exhausted chalk by now...

Occur_String4=Well, I was afraid... it's me again. What would you ask of me?
Occur_String5=Actually, there are quite a lot of big and small disappearances going on in the Myu continent recently. The problem is, the culprits are very discreet and never leave any evidence.
Occur_String6=It seems to be quite a problem. So, you want me to find the culprit?
Occur_String7=We are working on tracking the criminals... And I need you to visit Linda in Ohrdor.
Occur_String8=Linda, now? What has Linda got to do with the missing cases?

Occur_String2=Please don't cry... What's this about Lala missing? What happened?
Occur_String3=About Lala. She was very excited for months at the news of the nomadic carnival coming to Duelden. The carnival held by nomads is so famous that participating in it has been nominated for one of the 101 bucket list items of Myu continent.
Occur_String4=And she was so excited that it was going to be in Duelden, which was in her range... I have lost contact with her after she left for Duelden with other villagers.
Occur_String5=What if they ran into a terrible encounter with thieves on their way?
Occur_String6=Let's hope for the best. Where was the last place you had contact with her?

Occur_String3=My friend Linda... I knew she would be worried!<br>Adventurer, there are many other villagers who have been captured by the thieves.
Occur_String4=I made it to Parkin farm to inform the vigilantes about the Archean thieves, but most of the other villagers were captured near the Blackpalm farm.

Name=(T) Nomadic carnival
Occur_String1=This is a confidential matter because it's an internal affair of the kingdom, but I believe I can trust you so I'll share it. I have been assigned an undercover mission to dig into the secret lab of the Nobles' alliance.
Occur_String2=Currently, Lorensia is having problems caused by the ongoing conflict between the royal forces and the Nobles' alliance. Us Devias knights, with our duty to guard the crown are involved in the crisis as well.
Occur_String3=In such state of affairs, a powerful force has joined the Nobles' alliance all of a sudden. They possess powers so strong; it is hard to believe they belong to humans.
Occur_String4=I had my suspicions about the soldiers of the Nobles' alliance and began my investigation secretly. And finally, I found out that these soldiers were people who have been reinforced through human experiments. Human soldiers being reinforced by inhumane methods...
Occur_String5=They abducted people for the experiments. Still, the Nobles' alliance is not stupid enough to just kidnap people in broad daylight. They are kidnapping them through partnering with a mastermind. My guess is that they are also behind the recently frequent disappearances.
Occur_String6=And in the pursuit of them, I have found something of interest. The time and place where the disappearances were the most frequent overlaps with the route of the nomadic carnival...
Occur_String7=The nomadic carnival?
Occur_String8=Right. The grand festival going on right before your eyes.<br>I don't think that everyone from the carnival is connected to this case. I suspect the Nobles' alliance has been making deals with some of them and they are under secretive operations.
Occur_String9=By keeping an eye on the carnival, I found out that some of them joined the main group from Duelden to Ohrdor belatedly. I suppose they were taking care of the situation of Archean thieves, the ones you swept up.
Occur_String10=It was an unexpected situation, so they must have left their trace because they didn't have much time. Please make a surprise attack on their base at the time-space warp and find any clues on the nomadic carnival. I will keep my watch on them for any suspicious movements.

Occur_String3=No matter the urgency, leaving such obvious evidence... as if he wants us to follow him.

Occur_String2=Actually, a 'void pactra' is not a pactra. It's called that because it is an energy mass which absorbs pactra and dissipates. I'll never know why it's named pactra when it isn't...<br>Wouldn't a name like 'pactra eraser' be better?
Occur_String3=Anyway, we need to fuse the 'time-space magic' and 'time-space divinity' to make 'void pactra'. The original name is 'misaligned magic from distortion of time-space energy', but who can memorize such a long one?
Occur_String4=Get it and I'll make it for you.<br>The â€śtime-space magicâ€ť can be acquired at the â€śdemon incubator siteâ€ť, and â€śtime-space divinityâ€ť from â€śSkywind squareâ€ť.
Occur_String5=Both are accessible from the time-space warp. Hm... From any time-space warp?<br>Is there like... someplace that has more of them... or something?
Occur_String6=Who in the world could be so lucky. At least, I don't have a clue. But it's easy to gather once you get there.<br>I'll just... wish you luck.
Doing_String=But still, don't you think 'pactra eraser' sounds better?
Completable_String1=You got them much quicker than I expected. Wow! You're outstanding in both ability and luck. I envy you.<br>Please wait a moment. I'll craft 'void pactra' for you in no time.
Complete_String=(Drakans group quest) (2/6)<br>I collected both materials which are needed to make void pactra.
List_String=(Drakans group quest) (2/6)<br>There is a substance called 'void pactra' which only removes pactra, but I have to keep on traveling through the time-space warp to reach the 'demon incubator site' and 'Skywind square' to collect the necessary materials, 'time-space magic' and 'time-space divinity'.<br>Damn. I'll just have to trust my luck.

Name=(T) Delivering void pactra
Occur_String1=It's done. This is void pactra. Deliver this to that Drakans scholar.<br>Oh, and the usage is nothing too fancy. The void pactra absorbs pactra from its surroundings, so you need only to place them near.
Occur_String2=It has such an attribute, when I cannot sense any force from it? That's amazing.
Occur_String3=It only reacts to pactra. If you place it next to pactra, it will sparkle then grow smaller until it dissipates.<br>Use this for starters, then if it works fine, tell those Drakans scholar to come to me.
Doing_String=Get going. Wasn't it urgent?
Completable_String1=Here, I've got something named 'void pactra'. It's supposed to absorb only the pactra energy from its surroundings and disappear. If you place it next to Drakans, the pactra energy will be gone from Drakans.
Completable_String2=Fantastic! I can't thank you enough. Yes... Only the Kantur, specialized with pactra would know of this.
Completable_String3=Try it, and if it is effective then visit the Kantur scholar named Thulm. He will fill in the blanks.<br>Do you need anything else?

Name=(T) An immense threat
Occur_String1=%s_9_1! Brethren! I have an urgent request.<br>While checking what Quadro has done, I found out that the Drakans soliders reinforced by Quadro are gathered somewhere.
Occur_String2=It will be best if they surrendered or lead peaceful lives... but they keep on causing troubles of all kinds. Being fanatical followers of Ungpam and Quadro, they must have sworn revenge for them.
Occur_String3=We have not enough capacity as we have to clean up the stuff related to Quadro's treason, and there's also the chance for them to go into hiding if we make a move. Therefore, someone who is able and could be trusted has to solve this case alone, and swiftly.<br>And as far as I know, the only person cut out for that is %s_9_1.

Name=(T) The surviving Drakans soldiers
Occur_String1=What is the situation? Have you found any clues?
Occur_String2=Quadro divided the soldiers into three major groups based on their roles: assassins, blitzers, and rangers.<br>In emergencies, assassins were in charge of assassinating important persons, blitzers overall attacks, and rangers supported the other two troops according to situations.
Occur_String3=They were ready for anything. So why did he move by himself instead of mobilizing them?
Occur_String4=We are not sure of the details. But I assume the main reason was because of %s_9_1's movement. I supposed they planned to start a chaotic mess and when the forces of Drakanknights or other warriors were weakened from taking care of that, the Drakans would make their move. That must have been the main gist of the operation.
Occur_String5=But the mess was taken care of much earlier than their expectation due to %s_9_1's intervention. Or guessed that it could get wrapped up.<br>Anyway, I think that made Quadro act by himself as a last resort. I think they didn't use the reinforced Drakans troops because of such sudden change of plans.
Completable_String1=I have located the assassins and blitzers.<br>Assassins are in the time-space warp of Luiziane falls, and blitzers in the time-space warp of Qahanaan, and both have gone into hiding in their hideouts. On their own, they will make some trouble or run away.
Completable_String2=It will be a disaster if they make a move, and a nuisance if they run away. We have to take care of them at once. With no leftovers.

Occur_String1=Have we located the reinforced Drakans rangers yet?
Occur_String2=Not yet. Ahh... I expected this to be tough, but how is it possible we can't find them with all our resources and technologies, those soldiers are indeed able-bodied to support both troops.<br>If we were Quadro, where would we position the rangers?
Occur_String3=... Are you sure that the rangers can support both?
Occur_String4=I found it from the documents on Quadro. Among many things, the main task of rangers was to support both troops. I'm sure of that.
Occur_String5=Support could mean directly operating the troops. But, the size of assassins and blitzers was quite large. And if ordinary Drakans troops had engaged as well as the reinforced soldiers, they would have accomplished enough by themselves. In that case...
Occur_String6=Right... So what was the use of rangers? Sure, the more the better, but it's hard to think of such reinforced troops being simply 'spare troops'.<br>Then, was there some other purpose for them?
Completable_String1=... Qainaan village.
Completable_String2=Huh?
Completable_String3=Damn. I get it now. The purpose of their rangers is to cut off the capital from other places by occupying Qainaan village.<br>In an emergency, the troops that are spread all over Littenberg continent will come to defend the capital and the king. And the quickest way is through Qainaan village.
Completable_String4=But if Qainaan village is taken, such reinforcements will be hard to come by. Qainaan village is also a strategic point connecting to other continents.<br>If the rangers take over Qainaan village and take siege, Qahanaan will wear out before them.
Complete_String=(Drakans additional group quest) (5/7)<br>It seems that the purpose of the rangers is to occupy Qainaan village and isolate Qahanaan and Drakansor. Their chance of victory will increase greatly just by delaying the reinforcements of Drakans from getting there. I hope this prediction is right. Or we'll have to start all over again.

Complete_String=(Drakans additional group quest) (6/7)<br>Fortunately, it seems we have successfully stopped Quadro's plans. Well, stopping such a huge force that was on the stand-by, I guess there aren't any more surprises. But how could I guess such a thing. Maybe I was a general, like the agent said. It is surprising that I thought of such things so naturally. I hope I don't find out that I was a lousy person when I get my memory later.

Completable_String2=Ungpam and Quadro tried their best to make a mighty Drapia. But Ungpam crossed the line.<br>He formed the reinforced troops with unauthorized use of pactra and without informing the deceased king Kaselhike, and advocated war with Kantur. After that, as you already know, he was driven out along with the Drakans.
Completable_String3=Quadro was dead set against the expel of Ungpam, but to no avail. I'm sure he knew it too. In fact, the king wrapping it up by total expulsion of Ungpam was nonsense as well. According to Drapian laws, Ungpam's crime was eligible for execution.
Completable_String4=Now that I think of it... Quadro must have been plotting since then. Then he carried out his plans after what happened to Ungpam.<br>A revenge to those responsible for the death of his master... may sound too harsh.
Completable_String5=Even if the intention was pure, it is tyranny and obstinacy if the methods were not fair. That hurts a lot of people.<br>The biggest problem is not reflecting on their own actions because of such purity. They leave only the bloodied footprints of pain and despair.

Name=(T) Lemuria's intention
Occur_String1=The overall research was complete, and the job got done through commission. You must have had another plan to carry out Kundun's orders if I wasn't here.<br>Why are you going through all this, when it doesn't seem like a matter of urgency?
Occur_String2=Because it's the Kundun's order. As a Silver sparrowhawk and Silverfel knight... also as a subject, I'd like to do my best service to Kundun, the ruler of Media principality.
Occur_String3=It seems you have other reasons. I feel that you are really overachieving.
Occur_String4=That's... because I don't want to be a nuisance to Kundun. Shouldn't the Kundun's best pupil live up to that name? If the pupil didn't live up to the name, people would speak ill of the master. And I don't want that.
Occur_String5=And?
Occur_String6=I hope that he will approve of me. I wish I could be stand side by side with him..<br>Hey, isn't it enough now! I, I just want to be a subject, a pupil who lives up to the reputation of her lord and master, that's all!
Occur_String7='Just as I thought. Maybe I was too mean.'<br>Okay. Okay. Maybe I asked too much. I'm sorry. So, if the commissions are all done, I'll get going. Take care.

Occur_String9=Hm? What is it?
Occur_String10=I, no, nothing...

Completable_String1=%s_9_1! I heard about it. That you helped Lemuria.
Completable_String2=You did well. She was expecting something else from you. Not only that, everything was planned down to the details.
Completable_String3=She's one of my favorites. A fast learner, always diligent. Especially, I like the preciseness. A trustful pupil, and subject.
Completable_String4='Hm... I should inquire a little then.'<br>She really put her heart into her job. I was really surprised when I saw what she planned. It was almost too good.
Completable_String5=Hm. You thought so as well? Actually, I was thinking the same. Sure, from my perspective, quick and accurate results are fine.<br>But, how should I put it... she seems to be overachieving. It will do better if she relaxed a bit. Hm...
Completable_String6='Phew, as I thought... This fool Kundun, doesn't have a clue. Lemuria... it's gonna be hard.'
Completable_String7=Hm? What is it?
Completable_String8=... Nothing. I just felt a little stuffy.
Complete_String=(Silver sparrowhawks group quest) (6/11)<br>As I guessed, Kundun wasn't aware of anything. Well, Lemuria herself seemed not very daring or aggressive in these matters... I guess they are going to keep being like that for a while. Not that I can do anything about it... All I could do was sigh my pity.
List_String=(Silver sparrowhawks group quest) (6/11)<br>Lemuria had her reasons for the thorough preparation and planning. If anyone heard the same, they'll know she has a thing for Kundun at once. So let's see... What does Kundun make of her. Let's pay a visit.

Name=(T) A frustrated sigh
Occur_String1=... Ah, not again. That kind of thing doesn't just drop off trees, nor do they spring up to your face. I don't see why he keeps on doing this. Kundun is alright most of the times, but it really gets on my nerves when he does this. Just throwing impossible orders out of the blue. I don't know what he is aiming at. Really...
Occur_String2=It's like that again. He wants me to find a material which can be used for a new kind of magic. He makes it sound easy, but I'd like to see anything go that smoothly.
Occur_String3=Why don't you just tell him it's a tough job? Kundun is not so stubborn to listen to reason.
Occur_String4=That may be, but saying 'I can't manage that' It is a bit too much. I also feel a challenge as well. It feels kind of... like losing.
Completable_String1=I guess he keeps on asking you because you get work done. Maybe he approves of you.
Completable_String2=That could be... Still, I think it's too much. I was hoping to get some rest at home sweet home with the work at Drakansor done, and now I can't imagine how long this will take...<br>Well, I don't have a choice. I'll just have to find it.
Completable_String3=Tough. Let me help, if that's okay with you.
Completable_String4=I'll feel confident with %s_9_1's help. Thanks.
Complete_String=(Silver sparrowhawks group quest) (7/11)<br>I felt a little sorry for Karon, seeing him frustrated and lamenting. I feel that I should help.
List_String=(Silver sparrowhawks group quest) (7/11)<br>It seems Kundun is fond of throwing orders at random. They say a carelessly thrown stone may kill a frog. Although the comparison is a little severe in this case, the context is right. Anyway, Kundun doesn't strike me as someone who always make his moves on thorough calculation and planning.

Occur_String2=The place is dangerous, but I hear that some Drakans make a living by selling the minerals from that mine. They get a lot of money, and that means that they are special enough for its value.
Occur_String3=It seems plausible. Okay, I'll pay a visit.

Occur_String1=You have been a great help. I really didn't know what to do when I read Kundun's letter, but I can return with my head high, thanks to %s_9_1. Much quicker than I expected, at that.
Occur_String2=I'm sure you could have managed fine without me. You already had all the necessary information anyway. All I did was put in manual labor.
Occur_String3=You don't know how much help that was. Please get in touch when you're in Media. I'll treat you. I know a place where they serve truly astonishing grilled fish.

Completable_String2=It seems you're pretty good at judging people as well. Karon is a really fine guy. I never said this to his face, but he always delivers satisfying results when I entrust some job or mission to him.
Completable_String3=Honestly, I know that he wants to become independent from me, too. He is well-qualified and talented as well. But where else could I find someone with such talent? I don't want to let him go.

Occur_String2=... Take it easy. It seems like you have run away from the Nobles' alliance, which means that you're no longer attached to them. In that case, there's no reason for me to harm you.
Occur_String3=You'll let me live? Tha-thanks. Phew... I thought I was going to have a heart attack at the sight of you. It was so hard for me to get away...
Occur_String4=What happened? It looks pretty high. And the equipment looks well enough.
Occur_String5=What happened? Hah, don't even ask. All the hardships I went through because of that Adrian... gah, that piece of shit. All the mess he created, no matter how hard I cleaned up after him, he just can't help himself. He's the dirtiest guy you've ever seen.

Go to 'Brethrias plains' and keep going until you hit the area where the 'abandoned farmhouse' is located.<br>You'll be able to find the secret garrison in charge of Duelden continent by entering the time-space warp in the area.

Doing_String=Adrian... I hope he gets it in his neck. I'm not going down alone. No, I won't. Not so easily.
Completable_String1=How about it? Wasn't it worth it to believe what I said? That Adrian. I'm sure he doesn't even know what hit him.
Completable_String2=You said, 'the one in Duelden continent'. So there's a secret garrison like that one in every continent?
Completable_String3=Right. Duelden, Noria, and Enova. I know of those three. Of course, no one knows how many more Adrian has hidden up his sleeve, or where. I'm sure there are more of them. He's super good at pilfering and hiding stuff behind his back.

Occur_String4=It's pretty close to Ethedrian. Okay.
Doing_String=I really can't get over what that Adrian has done.
Completable_String1=That place is taken care of as well. Anyhow, the Nobles' alliance really astonishes me. I can get Duelden or Enova, but how in hell could they garrison their troops near Ethedrian and not be spotted by elves? Such a large force?
Completable_String2=The secret garrison in Noria is one of the oldest ones. They put in a lot of effort on that. I heard that an elf of high position lent a hand when building it. I believe the elf's name was 'Zacharian'.
Completable_String3=If Zacharian helped, it would have been a breeze. Damn. His name always comes up when anything goes on in Noria.

Occur_String2=Goblins are crying ... I can't believe it. What is it?
Occur_String3=Adventurer!  As you may know, there is an old castle where cherry blossoms bloom beautifully in spring not far from Ohrdor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The cherry blossoms there are so beautiful that it's a place where families and lovers go out for an outing.
Occur_String4=I did not guess at all that complaining to my boyfriend, Cardin, saying that I really want to go to the old castle to see cherry blossoms this year, will become a source of trouble like this.
Occur_String5=The cherry blossom viewing has become a source of trouble? I was told that there are a lot of villagers visiting the old castle. What happened there? Calm down and talk in detail. Unless you do so, I can't help you.
Occur_String6=Yeah... Me and Cardin visit Ohrdor every spring, show a magic show and sell homemade drinks. My boyfriend, Cardin, is a famous magician on the Mu Continent, and I'm a barista who's known for the taste.
Occur_String7=That's why I complained to my boyfriend, saying that I must see cherry blossoms this year because I've been so busy so far and I haven't had any real date. My boyfriend, Cardin, went to the old castle by adjusting the schedule through his going too far, feeling sorry for me.
Occur_String8=But it was already occupied by fearsome black wizards. Cardin and many others were captured by the terrible attacks of black wizards. I was also in danger of being caught, but I could barely run away because Cardin turned away the eyes of black wizards with magic.
Occur_String9=I heard that their captain, Sezark, committed an act of brutality, saying that he can no longer tolerate couples who come to see cherry blossoms in the old castle in spring while making much ado about nothing. He is an ill-natured bad man, a single who has never had a date for a lifetime.
Occur_String10=Well... I don't know why, but he is a pitiable guy. I will save Cardin. So don't worry too much.
Doing_String=I was leaving so quickly that I left everything I had there. I want to compensate something, but it's not easy.
Completable_String1=Thanks! Thanks to you, I was able to meet Cardin again. I am very glad.

Name=A big shot who appeared in the harbor
Occur_String1=What are you looking so surprised at? Have you seen a ghost?
Occur_String2=.. ... . .<br>Oh, you are % s_9_1. Gee. Don't get me started. The entire Guilds Harbor was on an emergency.
Occur_String3=Sir Muren, the leader of the Knights of Devias, came. I became extremely suffocated at a mere sight. This is not a part of the Kingdom of Lorencia, but he is the highest figure of the friendly nation. It does not make sense that we do absolutely nothing. That's why the troops lined up, and it was bedlam.<br>Since he has left, everything is tidied up now.
Occur_String4=Muren? Does he have any business to do here?
Occur_String5=Let me see. There were words about flying boats and devildom, but that's not what I can know, just guarding the harbor.
Occur_String6=Of course, it is. Do you know where Muren went? I want to see him in a while.
Occur_String7=I heard he is going to Sir Kundun's residence in Ohrdor. What does % s_9_1 think of going there?.
Doing_String=Looking at calling the names of Sir Kundun and Sir Muren, I think Sir % s_9_1 is amazing.
Completable_String1=%s_9_1! What is it?
Completable_String2=Nice to see you, %s_9_1. How are you? I heard what happened to you so far. You have done something incredible.
Completable_String3=By virtue of that, I had a hard time. Long time no see. <br> By the way, what's up? A meeting of the leader of the principality of Media and the leader of the Knights of Devias?
Completable_String4=There is a quite fun business. <br>Do you remember the flying boat to find the devildom? It refers to your stopping the subversive activities of demon monsters.
Completable_String5=The flying boat finally produced satisfactory results. We found a way to the devildom.
Complete_String=I can't believe you found a way to the devildom. It is really a splendid achievement. From the position of preventing the invasion of the devildom, it is time for us to launch a counterattack.
List_String=Muren visited the port of Knight and talked about the devildom and flying boat before heading to Kundun's residence. I was told that the best wizards and leaders of Knights on the Mu Continent gathered... I should go to Kundun's residence. Luckily, if it's not a big deal, it's a good idea to unburden ourselves while seeing each other in a while.
Mission_String=Meeting Muren and Kundun at the home of Kundun in Ohrdor
Mission_Target1=Talk with Kundun

[Quest_100002]
Name=Start of counterattacks
Occur_String1=Great! Do we finally have a chance to blow a punch to them?
Occur_String2=Right. We were just talking about you. If you help us, I think it will be a big help to the conquest. What do you think?
Occur_String3=Of course, I will help you. Bastard demon monsters, wash your neck and wait.<br>So how can we go to the devildom?
Occur_String4=In front of the entrance of the devildom, we built a base called the area to prepare for conquering cities of the devil. We can go there through the magic gate in the harbor of Knights. <br>Originally I had to go there by boarding on a flying boat, but after the base was built, I could break through the magic gate. I went to the harbor of Knights because of that magic gate.
Occur_String5=I see. Okay, so let's go there.
Occur_String6=Take this. It's an autographic certificate of me and Muren. Take this and go to Bareanne, commander of the area for conquering the cities of the devil.<br>Help her. There will be a lot for her to do.
Doing_String=I can't believe that a way to the devildom is open. I would have gone to fight right away if there weren't any people to take care of.
Completable_String1=Who is it? How did you get here?
Completable_String2=Seeing this paper will be more clear than I say who I am.
Completable_String3=This is ... an autographic certificate of Kundun and Muren. You are a person proved by the best humans in the Mu Continent. Then you must be % s_9_1?
Completable_String4=Good to see you. I am Bareanne commanding the area to prepare for conquering the cities of the devil. This is Sir Etramu, the Darkness Watcher, a sage who studies the devildom.
Completable_String5=Welcome. I have heard your reputation. It is my honor to meet you.
Complete_String=Commander Bareanne commanding the area to prepare for conquering the cities of the devil met the Sage Etramu. It is the base that borders the gateway to the devildom. The strange tension and excitement ahead of war are a feeling that the blood begins to boil little by little.
List_String=You shall go to Bareanne, the commander of the base called the area for conquering the cities of the devil, with Kundun and Muren's autographic certificate.
Mission_String=Talk with Bareanne, the commander of the base called the area for conquering the cities of the devil
Mission_Target1=Talk with Bareanne

[Quest_100003]
Name=Abyss of the area to prepare for conquering the cities of the devil and the cities of the devil.
Occur_String1=This place, the area to prepare for conquering the cities of the devil, is an outpost that borders the entrance to the devildom. As you can see, it's a base for the expedition of the devildom. <br>It's a place to support warriors and troops on the their way for the expedition of the devildom and to defend the invasion of the devildom in an emergency.
Occur_String2=The scale is considerable, too... The equipment given to the common soldiers seems to be quite precious. <br>And the divine energy from that obelisk... .
Occur_String3=Yes. All equipment was engraved with the sacred emblems of the priests to stop the energy of the devil, and a magical barrier that prevents the energy of the devil surrounds all over the base through obelisk. <br>Pride and vigilance are forbidden, but at least if you're in here, you don't have to worry about being invaded by demon monsters right away.
Occur_String4=How are these supplies possible? .
Occur_String5=Thanks to the power of Doomfain. Money is really scary. He changed from a miser only looking for golds to a patron of terrestrial peace in an instant.
Occur_String6=I guess he did not move for nothing ... Is this also a new business for Doomfain? I don't know what to say about him, after all.
Occur_String7=Anyway, without his cooperation, it would have been virtually impossible to make an expedition against the devildom. If you want to apply for our expedition against the devildom, this base will be a strong support for you. We would also love to have a great hero like you help us.
Occur_String8=Talk to Sir Etramu about the Abyss of the cities of the devildom. He knows more than I can say.
Doing_String=Talk to Sir Etramu about the Abyss of the cities of the devildom. He knows more than I can say.
Completable_String1=The devildom is a collection of dimensions abandoned by the Creator. Some of them are really like hell, but some may be really beautiful.
Completable_String2=It's the devildom, but beautiful?
Completable_String3=How do creatures like us know by what basis did the Creator give up his creation? The gross and terrible devildom that we think is just one of the stereotypes.
Completable_String4=For example, there may be a world that is so perfect that it is abandoned. There would be no change, no evolution, no improvement in that world. Wouldn't it be just like being dead?
Completable_String5=Right... If so, is there any dimension of the devildom that is friendly to us?
Completable_String6=Chances are slim, but I don't think it's impossible. We can't know how many dimensions the devildom has, and who lives in that place with what kind of appearance.
Completable_String7=Your power will be of great help to our expedition against the devildom. Please, please help us.
Completable_String8=Don't worry. I came here for that.
Complete_String=I heard a story about the area to prepare for conquering the cities of the devil and the devildom. The power and resources devoted to the area to prepare for conquering the cities of the devil was enormous. I'm a little worried that it is Doomfain who prepared those. And the explanation on the devildom is... I understand it from the story of Etramu, but I can't believe it until I see it.
List_String=I heard explanation on the area for conquering the cities of the devil from Commander Bareanne. Ask the Sage Etramu about the devildom.
Mission_String=Hear about the devildom from Etramu
Mission_Target1=Talk with Etramu

[Quest_100011]
Name=Weapons of the cities of the devil, Kylops red and blue.
Occur_String1=Weapons of the cities of the devil This is a completely different kind of threat from what we've been through so far. I thought it could be after I heard Sir Etramu's story, but I felt like I've been hit by something when I actually faced the fact.
Occur_String2=Weapons of the cities of the devil?
Occur_String3=Yes. It's a massive mechanical weapon operated by magic. Think of a monkey as big as a house. It's made of metals of the devildom that we have never seen. It was bombarding an attack with unimaginable power, and we've got to receive too much damage to the current troops.
Occur_String4=But there are two weapons like that. They've got the names of Kylops Red and Kylops Blue, respectively. From what we've investigated so far, it seems that Kylops Red is specialized in the processing of a single target, while Kylops Blue is specialized in attacking a wider range.
Occur_String5=If you take down those weapons, you will not only achieve great results in the conquest of the devil, but also be a great help to increasing morale. Please destroy the weapons of the cities of the devil.
Doing_String=Paying close attention to how Kylops Red and Kylops Blue attack will be the key to victory.
Completable_String1=Awesome! This is a great achievement. All the soldiers in the area to prepare for conquering the cities of the devil are cheering. Me too. Your fame and legend didn't just come out.
Completable_String2=Peace on earth is one step closer. Thanks to you. We will be able to face true peace someday. And % s_9_1, your name, will be written on that starting point .
Complete_String=Destroyed two giant weapons of the cities of the devil. What can we say? It was like an impregnable moving fortress seems to destroy everything near it. How many more terrible things are there in the devildom?
List_String=We must destroy giant weapons created by magic engineers, Kylops Red and Kylops Blue, driven by the power of the evil devildom.
Mission_String=Destroying the weapons created by magic engineers, a new threat of the devildom
Mission_Target1=Destroy Kylops Red.
Mission_Target2=Destroy Kylops Blue.

[Quest_100012]
Name=New spear and shield
Occur_String1=Those weapons of the cities of the devil are definitely the weapons of the enemy, but the technology in them far exceeds ours. If we can get it in our hands, we'll get a new spear and shield to face the devildom.
Occur_String2=Scholars, technicians, and wizards who heard about the weapons of wanted parts of those weapons, but they were doing research only by guessing because they were not able to do anything, but now it's worth a shot as you are with us.
Occur_String3=The technologies are essential for our true victory. <br>Can you collect the parts of Kylops Red and Kylops Blue? Each piece of parts you bring is a piece for peace on earth.
Doing_String=What we need now is information, nothing else.
Completable_String1=That's amazing. The giant weapons of the cities of the devil consist of these things. <br>% s_9_1, you did a good job. These parts will soon be delivered to many scholars, wizards, and engineers on earth. I'm looking forward to seeing the results.
Completable_String2=We could have watchers made of steel like those weapons. Who knows if we may head to the devildom by riding on it? Hahaha!
Complete_String=The parts of Kylops were delivered to Bareanne. There is a news that we may invade the devildom by riding on a giant magical steel weapons... Just imagine it is thrilling.
List_String=New technologies are needed to defend earth and create new means to attack the devildom. After destroying Kylops, let's collect the parts of Kylops that will contain new technologies.
Mission_String=Collect the parts of Kylops for a new attack and defense.
Mission_Target1=Parts of Kylops

Name=Request 1 of the surrendered demon monsters
Occur_String1=You have a deadly force. I am mortified. but it is incomparable to mine. One of terrestrial tribe has this power... Can you give me your name?
Occur_String2=It's %s_9_1. Well, I don't think you guys do not know me. I don't think you like me.
Occur_String3=%s_9_1! I see. Is it you who executed the commanders of army corps of the devildom? <br>.....<br>I think you can do it with that much power.
Occur_String4=It's not that I may have the power to do it, but I have already done it. Is it the only word you want to tell me?
Occur_String5=Nope! I have something to offer you. <br>The portal that the terrestrial tribe pierced is connected to the place called the abyss of boiling corruption. It's where the fallen angel, Quinirieol and his followers fell into the devildom during the Devil War.
Occur_String6=I lost a lot to the guy. My brethren and friends And my family I want them to pay the price, but my strength is too weak for them. It will be... useless death.
Occur_String7=Would you revenge them instead of me? Then I will cooperate with the terrestrial tribe. I don't know everything about the devildom, but at least I know more than you guys. Do you like it?
Occur_String8=I was thinking about hitting them anyway. I have nothing to lose. Will you keep your promise?
Occur_String9=Done deal Good It would be a good idea to kill his followers first. He has gathered huge forces since the Devil War. If you don't deal with them, it will be a long way to get to Quinireal.
Doing_String=To face with Quinireal, you must hit those followers first.
Completable_String1=I can see traces of countless demon monsters in you. Indeed! Are you the one who defeated the commander of army corps of the devildom? If I had had the same power as you, those who left me would still be with me.
Complete_String=Followers of Quinireal were killed. Now, in order to achieve his revenge, we must execute Quinireal.
List_String=The surrendered demon monsters say they have lost much to the fallen angel, Quinireal, and will cooperate with us if we revenge Quinireal for them. Accept his offer and first slay the followers of Quinireal.
Mission_String=Kill those who follow Quinireal.
Mission_Target1=Kill the followers of Quinireal.

[Quest_100022]
Name=Request 2 of the surrendered demon monsters
Occur_String1=We don't want to just kill Quinireal. Only his pain can heal the grudges of those who have died first. He must struggle in the terrible pain. Like we had.
Occur_String2=Pluck the Quinireal's wing and bring it to me. I will burn his wings with my magic, and tell my brethren that he is now gone. Then everyone will be able to find rest.
Doing_String=I hope revenge succeeds.
Completable_String1=Thanks to %s_9_1. This made me more comfortable. I don't think I will have a nightmare tonight. <br>By the way, I have not imagined to thank the terrestrial tribe.
Completable_String2=I never imagined I would help the demon monster's revenge and say thanks. Live and learn. <br>Will you keep your promise to cooperate with us?
Completable_String3=Of course. As a matter of fact, I said first while you went to Quinireal. He is coming to ask you something soon. Well, I didn't think you are going to cheat on me or will be killed by him.
Completable_String4=I see... Good choice. I will leave a word. Asking to take a good care of you Of course, assuming you don't betray first.
Completable_String5=It's up to you to believe me or not. You don't have to worry about that.
Complete_String=The surrendered demon monsters burned the wings of Quinireal with their magic, and the wings that lost their owner feebly burned in the air. I hope the information from the surrendered demon monsters will help us a lot.
List_String=The surrendered demon monsters will burn the wings of Quinireal and announce his death to their dead families and colleagues. Let's bring it for him.
Mission_String=Collect Quinireal's wings that the surrendered demon monsters want.
Mission_Target1=Quinireal's wings

[Quest_100031]
Name=Suspicious weapons of the cities of the devil
Occur_String1=In addition to Kylops, we have discovered the dimensions of the devildom with weapons of the cities of the devil. It's called the Abyss of Coagulated Blood.
Occur_String2=But the weapon of the cities of the devil is something special. Of course, Kylops might be more special for the devildom, but no matter how much I think, the weapons created by magic engineers in the Bloody Abyss are more suspicious. There must be something hidden.
Occur_String3=What's so unusual about it?
Occur_String4=First of all, the appearance of it is not that of weapon. It has the appearance of a beautiful female. Of course, it is a bizarre appearance with knives and awls all over the body, but the overall appearance looks like a well-made statue.
Occur_String5=It also speaks very clearly. Enough to talk with it. Most likely... Something like a soul may be in it.
Occur_String6=That's frightening.
Occur_String7=Of course, we must destroy the weapon created by magic engineers This is something that has to be done. If you find anything with which we can infer the identity of the weapon created by magic engineers, bring it with you.
Doing_String=The weapon created by magic engineers seems to have something hidden.
Completable_String1=This is a fragment of the weapon created by magic engineers. Let me take a look.
Completable_String2=Hm? Can you see this? Looks like letters. Oh yeah? This can be read as erzeta in our words... . Hmm, is it a coincidence?
Complete_String=We have found the name, Erzeta, in a fragment of the weapon created by magic engineers. It seems to be the name of the weapon created by magic engineers. By the way, what does coincidence mean?
List_String=Etramu wants to unravel the secrets of the newly discovered weapon created by magic engineers. To help him, let's try to destroy the weapon created by magic engineers and find some clues.
Mission_String=Destroy the newly discovered weapon created by magic engineers and get some clues for its identity.
Mission_Target1=Destroy the new weapon created by magic engineers.
Mission_Target2=Unusual fragment of the new weapon created by magic engineers

[Quest_100032]
Name=Clues of forgotten truth
Occur_String1=Erzeta It is the name of a wizard in the legend of the Devil War. Her magic is said to divide the land on which the unfaithful stand and burn the sky where they are flying.
Occur_String2=The great name is found in this bizarre magic machine... . Is it just the name of this machine? Or is the legendary wizard who made this? Or maybe it's just a homonym, or it's a completely different language, but it just has the appearance of ours by chance.
Occur_String3=Sir % s_9_1, if we can find more of these unusual fragments in the weapon created by magic engineers, we may be able to find out the forgotten truth. Can you collect more of these fragments?
Doing_String=What's visible is not the truth. There is something deeper beneath it.
Completable_String1=You did a great job,Sir % s_9_1. These things you brought will be sent to the Magic Association of the Principality of Media. If we keep track of the vast resources that are there, we may find the hidden secrets.
Completable_String2=The name Erzeta is never light. At least among wizards like us. In the record that remains for us, there is one last record that Erzeta suddenly disappeared some time ago.
Completable_String3=It's strange that the mighty wizard suddenly disappeared. This discovery may be a valuable clue to making the legend a reality. Great work, Sir %s_9_1. If something is known, I will let you know.
Complete_String=The fragments of Erzeta are sent to the Magic Association of the Principality of Media for further investigation and research. Something new may come out. By the way, isn't the weapon Erzeta? No way. A human can't become such a weapon. I laughed in vain at the thoughts passed by momentarily.
List_String=The name of the great legendary wizard, Erzeta, came from the fragments of a bizarre weapon created by magic engineers of the devildom. Of course, it may be coincidence, but it may be inevitable. We should look for more of these fragments.
Mission_String=Finding evidences that can lead to lost stories
Mission_Target1=Collect more Erzeta's fragments.

Name=Unprecedented business site
Occur_String1=Opening a street stall in this place Great!
Occur_String2=I never imagined to do business in front of the devildom. Our Ohrdor Commerce Group has priority to buy and purchase all the goods that used for conquering the cities of the devil, and everything found in the devildom.
Occur_String3=I heard that Doomfain supports the conquest of the cities of the devil. It is this the authority obtained as its reward.
Occur_String4=Yes. He's a hell of a man. No one would have imagined that he will see the conquest of the cities of the devil as part of his business. His scale is truly unimaginable by an ordinary man like me.
Completable_String1=The main business of our Ohrdor Commerce Group here is to find and sell the things of the devildom. Oh, of course, you can be comfortable because there's no chance that something weird will be distributed. All the steps are monitored by the Allies for the conquest of the cities of the devil.
Completable_String2=Doing this in such a cumbersome process should mean that it is very profitable?
Completable_String3=Yes. And considering % s_9_1's reputation and ability, I have a lot to ask in the future. Any item brought by the most reliable hero on the Mu Continent is always welcome. <br>Then I look forward to hearing from you.

Name=The riddle of Ancient Kanturians
Occur_String1=Hi, %s_9_1. You've come at a good time. There's been a new development in the Ark research.
Occur_String2=Did you find anything else?
Occur_String3=Yes, we studied the principles of the Ark. We built the portal to Ancient Kanturians Relic by mimicking the principles of the Ark.
Occur_String4=Ancient Kanturians Relic? Is there anything useful?
Occur_String5=The technology of the Ancient Kanturians is amazing. Maybe we can find something for more power.
Occur_String6=That sounds interesting. I also want to see if I can find a clue to my memory.
Occur_String7=However, because the research is not perfect, it is not yet able to accurately transmit. And the portal requires special energy.

Completable_String3=It seems that your findings are consistent with the information returned by the advance team we sent out.Perhaps the ancient Cantulians borrowed technology from the undersea nations of Atlantis. They defend themselves by restoring scenes from the intruder's memory.
