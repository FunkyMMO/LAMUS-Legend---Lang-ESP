Sub_Story_101601005=When Thud-tle was first created, the Ashas scientists wanted to name him Khkulsaz, after a monstrous beast from old stories. However, despite his monstrous size, Thud-tle was too tamed and good with people to be called a beast.

Sub_Story_101101296=Targash shouldn't have woken up so early. The mystical power in the Neria's Tears in Salormis needed more time to transform it into the marvelous form that destiny had in store for it. However, the Demons that invaded Earth and the Garudas that were desperate to revive their old glory ruined everything.<br>They ruthlessly took the Neria's Tears that had taken root in the land a long time ago, stripping Targash of its great destiny.<br>What remained was just a miserable pile of bones, mobilized by endless resentment and anger instead of veins and muscles.<br>Doomed to suffer from the results of its incomplete destiny, Targash hates everything that's whole, unlike itself, and only feels relief when it tears them apart and destroys them.
Sub_Story_101101306=Once upon a time, the Dracans worshipped the ancient dragons on which their form was based by their creator Bulcan. They worshipped them as much as they worshipped him. Their kingdom, Wallkreiger, once a superpower of Litenberg, worshipped one specific dragon: Kaizel, whom they called the Dragon King. They even built a large temple for it, and there, Kaizel looked after its followers.<br>Their harmonious coexistence, however, didn't last long. The Wallkreiger Kingdom became so powerful that it eventually grew lax, giving an opening to the Dark Mission to sneak in and corrupt its citizens. Time went by. The following of the Dark Mission in Wallkreiger grew big, slowly corrupting the kingdom's patron, Kaizel, along the way. This turned the great Dragon King into a mindless, evil creature.<br>Now Kaizel only wants one thing, the destruction of every living thing in Litenberg. It's ready to burn itself to nothing if that's what is takes to achieve that goal.
Sub_Story_101101816=This ancient dragon is nested inside a massive natural cave near the capital city of the ancient Wallkreiger Kingdom. It once drove the kingdom to the verge of destruction. One of its most notable (and destructive) accomplishments was that it scooped up a temple of Bulcan, the god of the Dracans race, along with everything else around it, and then sealed it in subspace.<br>When Death Roar made its appearance in the Empire, a large-scale delegation from Ashas had arrived there in the Wallkreiger Palace to discuss the formation of the Line Alliance, and it helped the Empire gather a large number of reinforcements. The allied forces of Wallkreiger and Ashas managed to seal Death Roar inside its lair, after tremendous sacrifices. This eventually destroyed Wallkreiger and caused Ashas to lose most of its land to foreign elves.
Sub_Story_100301825=The hierarchy of the Dracans Knights is determined by an annual promotion test, which is in fact a tournament among themselves. The winner of this tournament becomes the Commander who leads all the Dracans Knights. The runner-up then serves as the Master Knight who trains young aspiring warriors into Dracans Knights. <br>The current Master Knight, Yakan, is overwhelmingly stronger than other Dracans Knights. His only misfortune was that he was born in the same era as Chaisong, who's considered the strongest Dracans Knight in history. Yakan, being the magnanimous warrior that he is, has acknowledged Chaisong's superiority after accomplishing many difficult missions together. They are like brothers.
Sub_Story_100301833=Anan barely escaped from the Dracans Knights' southern base in the Realm of Perseverance after it was occupied by the thrashers that came pouring out of a Rift. Afterward, he built a temporary defense base with a small number of surviving soldiers and has been treating the wounded from there.
Sub_Story_100301841=An instructor in the Dracans Knights' southern defense line along the Realm of Perseverance. He's keeping an eye on the Chakuas that have been making suspicious movements as of late.
Sub_Story_100301851=After the Dracans Knights' northern base in the Realm of Perseverance was occupied by the Oneys that came pouring out of a Rift, he gathered the surviving soldiers, built the current defense base, and has been treating the wounded from there.
Sub_Story_100301861=The gatekeeper of the massive Gates of Glory that connect Dracansor to the Realm of Perseverance. He gives a brief explanation about the realm to every Dracans trainee who passes there, along with a map containing various topographical details.
Sub_Story_301801876=A mysterious being with one wing as blue as the midday sky and the other as red as the setting sun. Because of her appearanceâ€”a beautiful woman with wings on her backâ€”it's easy to think she's an angel. She says she's something similar to an angel, which means that, technically, she's something else. The sight of her swinging a pair of swords and commanding power as immense as the sea is a wonder itself. It's rather strange how there's no record or even a folk tale about such a powerful entity.<br>She playfully tests the warriors she finds interesting, and if she's satisfied with them, gives them a very small gift, but the gift is only small compared to her power. It's actually powerful enough to make its earthly recipient the leader of their kind.<br>Only Gabriela knows what she's up to and what this game she's playing means. But if she means you harm, I hope you'll figure it out quickly.
Sub_Story_201901886=The Ashas telepathically communicate with each other, with the mind of their Pope King Bellias as the center of their network.<br>But the heightening of his consciousness caused by the war with the elves kindled a strong desire, and this desire became tainted by a curse of Pandemonium.<br>To protect his people from this terrifying curse, he severed his connections with them and tried to fight the encroaching Pandemonic energy by himself. Eventually, he reached his limits and succumbed to the energy that altered his mind.
Sub_Story_100401896=She's very young, for an elf who usually lives for a thousand years, barely having reached the age of maturity. However, she has already been recognized for her leadership and talent and was selected as the next queen of the Noria Kingdom after Cara. <br>Wanting to see the world before she ascends to the throne, she's traveled different continents on Earth and fought various evil forces along the way.<br>This experience has made her realize that the elves must get ready to embrace the changes that might be waiting for them in the future.
Sub_Story_102001905=The representative and great leader of the Ashas that live scattered across the Noria continent and everywhere else on Earth.<br>He's praised by his kind for his effective response to the natural environment and the elves and other native races of Noria when they first came to the continent.<br>He's disciplined his mind for a long time and achieved a true state of inner quiet, only to open his mind to the internal invasion of Pandemonium.
Sub_Story_102001914=He's with the Ashas Army on the Noria continent that's fighting the invading elves.<br>At first, he acts out in anger and hatred toward the elves, but as time goes on, he becomes more reasonable and less emotional.<br>He's so strong-minded that he's able to resist the Pandemonic energy that has encroached upon every other Ashas's mind.
Sub_Story_102001923=The highest priest of the Ashas Temple. Unlike his student, Fratanne, he stays out of the public eye and prays for his kind and country.<br>Since war broke out in Noria, he's made it his duty to appease the spirits of his people who were sacrificed in the war.
Sub_Story_102001932=He governs Sleighbowa, the capital city of the Ashas State, with the authority he received from Pope King Bellias.<br>As he noticed the strange changes in Bellias's mind first, he volunteered to become his sole aide, but the situation was more difficult to handle than he thought.
Sub_Story_102001942=He led the most reclusive of all native tribes that live in Ashas territory. He and his people were driven away from their land when war broke out between the Ashas and the elves.<br>He's hoping that he could trade his ancient knowledge for his village.
Sub_Story_102001951=An Ashas who lost everything to the Pandemonium invaders that have taken advantage of the Noria War. He accidentally provides you with some good information, saving himself.
Sub_Story_102001961=He protects the Shrine with his life to help maintain the telepathic connections among the Ashas soldiers fighting the elves.<br>In the process, he loses all his colleagues and sustains grave injuries.
Sub_Story_102001971=The Guard Captain of Sleighbowa, the capital city of the Ashas State, he forms a temporary alliance with the Shadow Phantoms of the elves to resist the Dark Shadows, but he's unable to trust them completely because of his comrades that he lost to the elves.
Sub_Story_100101985=Since the Power of Pure Darkness was discovered, a group of mages had been looking for someone with the potential to become a Black Phantom. But even the most talented candidates that they'd found were unable to withstand the impact of losing their balance between light and darkness.<br>Then, one day, they heard about a human female mage named Black Lotus who ruled the slum of Qwahadan, the capital city of Drapia. Rumors are usually exaggerated, but this one about the mage who'd dominated the worst of the Dracans race, beings notorious for their ruthless supremacy, was extremely interesting.<br>So, the mages went to Black Lotus and propositioned her about becoming a Black Phantom. She accepted it gladly. To her, it was an opportunity to get out of that accursed hellhole and move to a higher place in life.<br>At first, the mages didn't expect much from her, but soon their skepticism changed to astonishment. Her innate talent for magic, combined with the professional training and knowledge that the mages provided, made her stronger almost instantly. Every time someone praised her for pioneering a path that no one before her could, she'd just laugh and say, "This is just a walk in the park. I grew up worrying about getting food for the day, or a roof over my head, or getting beaten to death..."<br>After long, painstaking efforts, finally it was time for her to use the Power of Pure Darkness. Dark energy radiated from her body as the concentrated mana in her system started running amok. Soon, a fierce beam of darkness was shot from her, destroying the target in front of her without a trace. Her fighting spirit that had brought her this far didn't betray her, even when she lost her balance between light and darkness.<br><br>A good, positive environment produces positive outcomes, and no, they're not called miracles. True miracles are like the beautiful lotuses that bloom out of dirty, foul-smelling mud pits. Just like her.<br>This was how the very first Black Phantom was born.
Sub_Story_100101994=The Black Phantom is a mage specialized in the Power of Pure Darkness that gives rise to beings, just like the Power of Pure Light.<br>When one loses their balance between light and darkness, they suffer severe damage to their mind and body, and degenerate into a Demon or monster in the long run. But the Black Phantom, thanks to her superb magical talent and long, diligent training, is capable of intensifying her power of darkness and stealing the power of darkness from others. In this way, she can throw them off balance while using their own power of darkness against them.<br>Because she's associated with darkness, people often regard her with trepidation. However, it doesn't take long before their misunderstanding turns into respect as they see her use the Power of Pure Darkness to fend off evil forces.<br>Also known as the Safeguarding Light from Darkness, she uses her dark power to comfort the good and bring inescapable nightmares to the evil.
Sub_Story_402102005=At that time, Akneria was getting ready to go into a deep sleep, leaving only a part of her behind to recover the power that she lost during the Divine War. The humans were spreading across Earth, settling down here and there. However, there was an obstacle in their advancement: the Demons that invaded Earth during the war and decided to stay, instead of leaving with the others.<br>When some continents were completely devastated by these Demons, a massive Rift appeared in Juturus, the biggest hub city and trading post on the Lorencia continent, bringing in a horde of Demons. On the verge of destruction, the city dispatched its elite knights to hold off these invaders until help arrived from outside. While fighting the enemy, the Juturus Knights had learned how to use the authority of oracles at the cost of their life energy. They were the precursors of the Dark Lords who use holy power in combat.<br>As honorable knights who fight for justice with their holy power from their god, they bravely take the punishment from the enemy, so that their allies can focus on fighting. They've given up their human traits and trained to single-mindedly complete their missions. They're more reliable than anyone else on the battlefield.
Sub_Story_402102015=The origin of the Bladers dates back to the ancient Wallkreiger Kingdom that existed on the Litenberg continent. In its earlier days, the kingdom was divided into the leading and working classes in an effort to cope with the damage it received during the Divine War. But what started off as the simple division of roles gradually became a social hierarchy. The upper class's greed and abuse of power eventually caused the lower class to rise in revolt. To overthrow the upper class that had everything at its command, the lower class resorted to an ancient forbidden magic. They used the power of madness that made each and every one of them the equal of a hundred warriors.<br>Eventually, the upper class lost the struggle, and peace returned to Wallkreiger, but only briefly. The warriors who resorted to the power of madness were so intoxicated by their power that they couldn't live normal lives. They ended up bringing the entire kingdom to ruin. However, some people continued to practice this forbidden physical augmentation magic, and they eventually managed to refine it to a controllable level. They're now acknowledged among various races as a legitimate class of warriors, the Bladers.
Sub_Story_402102025=The War Mages were born as a result of the unstable mana that leaked from the Heavens and Pandemonium into Earth during the First Divine War.<br>The humans and members of other earthly races, who were used to the weak mana of Earth, couldn't control this amplified, extremely unstable flow of magical energy. They had to give up using it, or risked getting killed in a mana explosion.<br>Those who risked their lives and survived became capable of enhanced magic, and they even developed various tools, such as one that could store the unstable mana within it for emergency use. Their ability to control this mana and their tools were also effective in combat. They gave birth to the magic warriors, the War Mages.
Sub_Story_402102035=The Whisperers' story begins with the meeting of two sisters, born of two different races. Right after the Divine War that ravaged the entire world, Costiana of the Blue Moon, a tribe of elves, discovered a wounded human infant at the entrance to her forest.<br>Taking pity on the baby girl, Costiana took her to her forest and named her Whispinel. Whispinel grew up with Costiana, learning combat skills daily. Even though they were of two different races, their bond was stronger than that of sisters.<br>At that time, the elves were in an endless war with the goblins. Ace archer Costiana and expert trapper Whispinel joined the war, and together they led the elves to victory.<br>After the war, the elves decided to learn the sisters' exceptional fighting skills, and those who studied under their tutelage were named the Whisperers, as in the Whisperers of Death.
Sub_Story_402102045=The Spellbinders, members of the Kanturian race, are capable of harnessing a power long lost to the rest of their kind. After the Divine War, and having forgotten the origin of its transcendental civilization's technology, Kanturu became alarmed by the weakening of its dominance. In their efforts to reclaim their former power, they managed to create what amounts to a replica of their ancient technology.<br>With this replica, however, it became possible to create children who could use the power that their race had possessed in its prime. These children are the Spellbinders. Extensively trained in mind manipulation, they can control the objects around them with ease.<br>As masters of psychokinesis, the Spellbinders control everything within their reach, from weapons to people's minds, to strike terror into their enemies.

Sub_Story_402102067=The first Guardian to subdue Gabriela, the mysterious angel that threatens Ethedrean, will be awarded with a special Talisman with their name engraved on it. With such a great reward at stake, I won't just stand idly by, watching others fight over that honor.<br><br>As a Dark Lord, my role in the party is to fight Gabriela in the front line and keep her lackeys away from my allies, so they can focus on attacking her. I've done this hundreds of thousands of times before, but it feels different this time. Gabriela is incomparable to any other enemy I've fought. Even the tiniest mistake can lead to the elimination of the entire party. Of course, I've brought lots of Resurrection Stones and potions, but I'll run out of them, eventually.<br><br>I sprang forward at Gabriela, making sure her eyes stayed focused on me. Yes, look at me. Feel my burning love for you!<br><br>I persistently followed Gabriela, dragging her henchmen along with me. I froze, burned, and scorched them as much as I could. I hoped the others were fighting as hard as I was. Of course, I wouldn't have joined them if I didn't trust them.<br><br>After attacking and defending for a long time, we managed to stop Gabriela. We couldn't completely overcome her power, but we stopped Ethedrean's destruction, and the Happle Guild was the first party to stop the angel. Now, I've got a Talisman with my name engraved on it. I really have a reason to be proud of myself!
Sub_Story_402102077=The forgotten ark of the Kanturians... and my name happens to be Ark. Well, it's just a coincidence, but I don't dislike it.<br><br>We covered all the basics, and then headed for where Gabriela was. Potions took up the most space in our bags. They ranged from health recovery to various buff effects. Looking at them, I suddenly realized I drank tons of potions to get here. On that note, I think the taste of potions is as important as their effects.<br>Sometimes, Reira in Ohrdor offers various foods as event items that taste and work better than most potions. I'd love to stock up on them, but they don't last as long as potions...<br><br>After that short train of thought, I entered battle with Gabriela. All hell broke loose. It was like nothing I'd seen before.<br>Bombs falling, swords clashing, fire blazing, ice appearing out of nowhere, and lightning striking. The ground split and there were explosions everywhere. This must be quite a spectacle from a safe distance, but it's a living hell when you're in the middle of it, getting frozen and scorched.<br><br>In the end, we couldn't take down Gabriela, but we must have fought hard enough to impress her. She retreated, looking pleased. And we became the first party and guild to stop her disastrous attack. After the battle, I craved a cold tankard of mead. Today's great victory alone would make it taste amazing, even without any food to go with it.
Sub_Story_402102087=We, the elite members of the Happle Guild (Ark, Mr. Paik, Baby, Master, and me), headed for the Forgotten Ark of Ancient Kanturians and encountered Gabriela. We'll be the first group to subdue her, we declared!<br><br>Mr. Paik and Master charge toward her. Hm. They're so brave and reliable. Good meat shields, too.<br>From a safe distance, Ark, Baby, and I pour everything we've got onto Gabriela while evading her attacks. I better keep track of my mana regeneration and skill downtime, or I might run out of mana when I need it most.<br>The guys in the front line are doing a good job keeping Gabriela busy, but they're unable to protect us from the sporadic attacks that spread throughout the area. We'll just have to dodge them as best as we can. If we fail? Well, I didn't bring all these Resurrection Stones for no reason.<br><br>Her attacks rain down from the sky and shoot up from the ground. I feel years of my life being drained out of me as I'm grazed from all sides. One mistake is all it takes to get us killed. I follow my instincts honed by my experience, moving and attacking.<br><br>Finally, we end up being the first group to subdue Gabriela... Well, technically she vanished, saying that she had fun playing with us. But for now, I'm happy for this little victory and the great Talisman that I've been awarded.
Sub_Story_402102097=It came down to Ark, Mr. Paik, Eden Valley, Baby, and me. We must use everything we've learned while fighting together for this battle. It may sound difficult, but it's simple, really. We'll just have to do what we always do. And there's only one goal: become the first.<br><br>I readjusted my grip on my sword and entered the Pectra Storeroom where Gabriela was. This mysterious room was filled with the brilliant light from Pectra, and in a flash, Gabriela appeared from nowhere. Slowly walking toward us, she summoned a sword out of thin air. We took the fight to her.<br><br>Mr. Paik's shield and scepter stopped her sword. I used that moment to leap into the air and slashed at her as I landed. Eden Valley sniped at her with her powerful bow while Baby showered her with barrages of projectiles. Ark's overwhelming attack spells and techniques exploded in the air, in vivid flashes of colorful light. We used everything we had for the honor of becoming the first ones to stop Gabriela.<br><br>And we earned it. Having been pleased by our fighting skills, Gabriela left the Ark. We each were given a Talisman with our names engraved on it. The names of the five of us and the Happle Guild were forever recorded in the history of MU.
Sub_Story_402102107=We entered battle with the angel who had been waiting for us at the end of the forgotten ark of the Kanturians. I didn't know how long we'd been fighting, but I was getting annoyed at the sight of this angel. The whole time, she looked relaxed without any signs of sweating (if angels can even sweat). She even took it easy at the beginning and didn't even reveal her extra sword and set of wings until later. WHAT!? Yes, that wasn't fun.<br><br>Now she had two swords and two pairs of wings. I felt four times more pressure than before. I know this sounds strange, but that was exactly how I felt at that time. I also got worried about my bow's durability, and tried to remember if I brought an extra bow with me. Things were so bad that I was worrying about breaking my bow, never mind running out of arrows.<br><br>Fortunately, the situation I dreaded never happened. Gabriela asked if we were satisfied with the fight and said she'd see us again before she disappeared, looking as glamorous as when we first saw her. We fought tooth and nail, but it was all fun and games to her. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't upset, but the first and foremost feeling I had was relief. We, the members of the Happle Guild, joined forces and protected Noria. That's what matters most at this moment.<br><br>By the way, I got a Talisman with my name engraved on it! I feel honored to be recognized like this with the other heroes of MU.

His investigation shows that the Nobility Alliance abducted villagers and biologically turned them into these killing machines. This infuriates Muren to no end, but he maintains his cool. He continues his investigation to find the person responsible for such inhumane practices so he can punish their employer, the Nobility Alliance.<br>There are many obstacles in his path, but he doggedly follows the traces of the culprit, which eventually leads him to a carnival troupe that may or may not be related to the abductions of the villagers. The sheer size of the troupe's camp in Ohrdor shocks Muren, but he quickly gathers his wits and focuses on finding the culprit among the crowd.

Linda, disappointed that she can't spend more time with her old friend after their reunion, asks if she can come along. She says she'd like to personally thank Muren for saving Lalla and the villagers, and wants to help him with these cases.<br>After many twists and turns, Linda finally arrives in Ohrdor. She's now determined to help Muren, completely oblivious that he's uncomfortable around her because she's the granddaughter of Cerberus, the army commander of the Lorencia Kingdom, who's also happens to be his teacher.
Sub_Story_102502644=Echo is the second oldest member of the carnival troupe after the ringmaster, Momorin. He was acknowledged for his management skills early on and worked hard for the troupe, but he lost the ringmaster position to Momorin.

Sub_Story_102303227=Luery has amassed an immense fortune, thanks to her family's wealth, her talent, and the substantial amount of profits that she's earned through the Rift Research Society. She's so rich that she uses Rifts as her personal warehouses.<br><br>But of course, she's still not happy. So, she took on a new challenge.<br>From the information she gathered in the Rifts, she saw the image of an exotic haven in a different dimension on a different time track. A blazing sun. A glittering beach. Sea waves. Cool shade under big palm trees. The perfect place to get away from it all!<br><br>Having realized the business potential of this place that was not like anywhere else on the MU continent, she seized the opportunity without hesitation. She found just the right island for her purpose and transformed it into the dreamy place that she saw. Soon, the white sandy beach was filled with luxurious resort facilities. She even built a village for her resort staff.<br><br>When Caribe Paradise was finally opened, it became such a hit that even Luery herself was surprised. Despite the slightly expensive prices, it became the most popular place on the MU continent. Everyone dreamed of coming here at least once in their lifetime.<br><br>Speaking of dreams, Luery has another dream that she wants to achieve in this beautiful paradise. If all goes well, she'll win the heart of the man she loves. Let's wish her good luck.
Sub_Story_102303237=There's a mysterious man in Caribe Paradise.<br>His shoulders are as broad as the horizon, and his body is as muscular and beautiful as a classical sculpture. And when he surfs, he looks so beautiful that everyone stops what they're doing and gawks at him in spite of themselves. He has a face that looks as gentle as a doe with deep, shimmering eyes. His quiet mystique is so captivating that he's followed by many women wherever he goes.<br><br>Usually, attractive men like him are quickly discovered by the watching eyes of the public, but this one has managed to stay hidden this long. What's more mysterious is that he can only be seen here at this resort, surfing. He's so mysterious that some people even believe that he's a prince of an ancient underwater civilization.<br><br>Not many people know this beautiful Adonis of a man is actually Venti. This unbelievable truth is only known among his peers at the Rift Research Society. Who knew that hunched-back, stuttering, slow-as-sloth researcher was this hunky surfer?<br><br>When Venti showed up in Caribe Paradise, looking the way he did, Hyre and Ross were shocked. (Venti's sister, Grande, has known the truth all along, of course.) Even Tall had a look of astonishment on his usually expressionless face. As for Luery, she had to cover her mouth to stop herself from squeeing like a little girl. She felt so embarrassed that her face turned the same color as her hair.<br>And Mukler started hiccuping, and didn't stop for a long time. It's said that Mukler became noticeably more respectful toward Venti afterward.
Main_Story_102302625=Perfect looks, clear and pure skin, an aura that exudes regal nobility, and incredible wealth... That's what people say about me! Me! Ho ho!
Main_Story_102302635=I can always sense a powerful Rift Warp whenever I see you. It's as if you've transcended time and space...
Main_Story_102302644=M-Mukler is troublemaker from... the Rift Research Society... B-but! There's no one that knows more about the Rift than him.
Main_Story_102302654=Staying too long in the Rift will expose you to the energy of the Rift. Symptoms of the exposure begin with mild dizziness, but eventually your mind and body will be altered until the Rift consumes you. Basically... you become a monster.
Main_Story_102302664=I can't afford to make any mistakes if I want to be like Venti!
Main_Story_102302673=Perhaps the Rift predators are knights or warriors from other dimensions beyond the Rift.
Main_Story_102302683=Lastly, we've placed a special device that's suitable for this special place. It's called the Spring, and it lets you adjust the "level" of the labyrinth.
Main_Story_302202696=Is it true, Pamela? Can I really surpass him if I can just get my hands on that artifact?
Main_Story_302202706=Was it all but a fleeting mirage? This cold season... And this heavy loneliness... They all seep into the abyss of my heart...
Main_Story_302202716=Isn't it rude to ask a lady about her age? Ho ho!
Main_Story_102402725=Hang in there, Venti... I'll be sure to find you. We'll be able to spend eternity here together.
Main_Story_102402735=That is not what true love is like. Please, I beg of you... Please let me go now. Luery...
Main_Story_102402744=Ribbit, ribbit, rib-bit, rib-b-bit! My voice sounds extra lovely today! Ribbit!
Main_Story_102402754=Luery... You manipulative Arkean sow! I'll get my revenge on you one day!
Sub_Story_102302625=Luery grew up in an immensely wealthy family. With the conviction that more money is always better, her father did anything and everything to keep growing his wealth. Her father's obsession over wealth had a great impact on how Luery saw wealth and money. Being able to live in affluence was a source of great relief and satisfaction for her. Thanks to her father's influence, Luery grew up to value money as the most important thing in life.<br>Luery proved to be particularly talented in persuading others to do her bidding, and continuing to manage them. With her skills, Luery hired all sorts of creatures to help her secure even more wealth. Impressed by her ability, Dumpain of Ohrdor tried to hire her to lead a new business project, offering a tremendous salary and the position of CEO.<br>Dumpain's eye for talent turned out to be completely accurate. Upon accepting the offer, Luery scouted talent required for the Rift Research Society from all over. Under her leadership, the Rift Research Society began to produce some truly incredible results.
Sub_Story_102302635=Mukler was a brilliant prodigy, but perhaps because he was abandoned by his parents, he was also recognized as a problem child. After such a troubled childhood, he ran away from the orphanage to begin a life of wanton debauchery.<br>He wandered the world, making a comfortable living by conning others. When he tried to con Luery, who is around his age, Mukler finally met his match. In fact, he ended up with a serious debt that he has to pay her. And thus, his life began to get complicated. When Luery later became the CEO for Rift Research Society per Dumpain's behest, Mukler also became a member of the Society. There, his natural genius talent began to shine.<br>Although Mukler's accomplishments dwarf those of his peer researchers, much of his performance award has been used to pay off his debt to Luery. Mukler himself doesn't seem to mind the arrangement all that much. He continued to retain a fairly renowned status in the Rift Research Society, inventing the Rift-controlling device "Trenta" and even discovering the uncharted territory of "Lupa's Library." Refusing to be complacent with such accomplishments, Mukler now wants to wield complete control over the Rift, hoping to become capable of going to any time and place of his choosing.<br>Then, one day, he finds a new possibility in a Contract Knight who is free from the influence of the Rift Warp, and has been watching the knight closely since.
Sub_Story_102302644=Venti was a shy Arkean researcher who studied the Rift alone back in his hometown. Then, one day, Luery pays him a visit out of the blue, extending the nearly obligatory invitation to the Rift Research Society.<br>Although he was a bit startled by Luery's forward approach, he was persuaded by the generous salary offer since he was the breadwinner of his family. He then asked Luery to hire his siblings as well, and she readily agreed. Since then, Venti began to grow attracted to Luery's proactive and bold personality that sharply contrasted with his own. He eventually ends up being exploited by Luery, granting her every wish.<br>In the Rift Research Society, Venti worked with Mukler as his partner to achieve many things. Although he praised Mukler for his unrivaled knowledge in the Rift, Venti doesn't seem to hold Mukler in a completely positive light, as he referred to Mukler as "a rude troublemaker" - strong words for someone as shy as Venti.
Sub_Story_102302654=Having joined the Rift Research Society at Venti's suggestion, Grande specializes in studying artifacts crafted from the fragments of the Rift. Although she wasn't all that interested in the Rift when she first joined, she grew enchanted by the infinitely vast space-time she discovered in her studies. Now, she is an even more recognized researcher than her older brother Venti. Her strenuous efforts seem to have taken a toll on her body recently.<br>She was always sweet, even as a child, and was incredibly worried for her brother working in the Rift. She even immediately recognized Toll's necklace, which the Rift watchman had. It's undeniable that she deeply loves her family.<br>One day, she ran into a Contract Knight while studying the Rift's energy, and learns that the knight is "immune" to the Rift Warp. That's when Grande began to focus her curiosity on the Contract Knight.
Sub_Story_102302664=Tall is a member of the Rift Research Society, and a custodian of the garden found in the Rift, left behind by Fabrice, the god of crafting. Due to his taciturn nature, not much is known about Tall other than the fact that he's trying very hard to become like his older brother Venti, whom he respects very much.<br>One day, he finds himself in a rut when he falls short of the Rift watchman quota required for research. He then asks the Contract Knight, whom he happened to meet, to collect some samples. Although it was a simple request, the Contract Knight surprisingly brought the same earrings as his.<br>Tall then briefs the Rift Research Society about the watchman's earrings and the knight's description of the event. Having heard this report, Luery has the most renowned researchers tackle this topic. Thanks to their efforts, they discover that the watchmen are in fact the Rift Research Society members of other dimensions.<br>This put Tall in a rather awkward position at first. He was merely providing his usual report, which suddenly led to a ground-shaking discovery. Although he was startled by his sudden and newfound fame, Tall was elated to realize that he had grown a step closer to becoming like the brother he respects so much. Of course, he'd never show it.
Sub_Story_102302673=Always kind and polite to others, Hyre is one of the more relatively normal members of the Rift Research Society. Perhaps because of that, she abhors impolite behavior, often rebuking her fellow researcher and younger brother Ross for it.<br>She is mainly responsible for preventing and delaying physical mutations in the bodies of those who enter the Rift. She is particularly interested in the Rift predators that appear in the labyrinth, about which she has a fairly convincing theory. She believes that the predators are knights or warriors who failed to escape from the labyrinth after entering it for whatever reason they each had. She hypothesizes that the extensive time spent in the labyrinth mutated their bodies and eroded their minds.<br>Hyre continues to strive to prove her theory and win recognition as a prominent researcher in the Rift Research Society.
Sub_Story_102302683=Like Mukler, Ross is a playful, confident young man. He's often scolded and restrained by Hyre, who cannot stand rude behavior. But when Ross is talking about the labyrinth, even Hyre endures his cocky attitude.<br>His knowledge in the labyrinth is unmatched, even among those in the Rift Research Society. Among his achievements, he is particularly proud of his work on the Spring, which can adjust the labyrinth's levels by warping the Rift.
Sub_Story_302202696=With her pure passion for swordcraft, she became known as the greatest swordswoman on the continent. However, her title always remained the greatest "swordswoman," and not simply the greatest sword wielder of them all. This is because there was always that one person who overshadowed her.<br>After tireless efforts, Magarinne achieved a nimble, acute, yet beautiful style of swordplay. However, she still lacked power. She was far too thin to overcome her physical limitations. Nevertheless, Magarinne never gave up, always striving to overcome her limits. She almost obsessively honed her swordcraft to become faster and more lethal.<br>However, all that effort eventually betrayed Magarinne. When she finally despairs that she may never overcome her rival, she succumbs to the witch Pamela's sweet temptation.<br>Pamela tells Magarinne that "the labyrinth" in the Rift has an object that would bring Magarinne's swordplay to the level she desires. Having found new hope in Pamela's words, Magarinne set off to the labyrinth in search of the artifact known as Frenzy.<br>For reasons unknown, however, Pamela never told Magarinne about the deadly side effects of becoming exposed to the Rift Warp in the labyrinth. Even to this day, Magarinne continues to remain trapped in the labyrinth in an endless search for the Frenzy artifact, even if she can barely remember who she is.
Sub_Story_302202706=Tulan is an ancient country that once existed in an unimaginably distant corner of the Rift. Wachenrode, its absolute ruler, was so prideful that he was willing to challenge the gods themselves. Under Wachenrode's leadership, the entire city prospered. He attracted many followers and worshippers. He was certain that not even the gods could build a more perfect kingdom than his.<br>Perhaps it was his hubris that incurred their wrath... One day, everything in Wachenrode's world froze over. A mere ancient frost dragon had flown over Tulan, yet the bustling market with all its people, and even the many flowers dotting the fields, all froze over. The only creature left unfrozen was the poor Wachenrode.<br>Left all by himself in the frozen castle, Wachenrode felt so helpless and pathetic. In his prolonged solitude, his sadness festered into agony then eventually became a grudge against the being that took everything from him. Wachenrode set out to find the ancient dragon to exact his revenge.<br>However, he could not find even a trace of the dragon anywhere. After wandering aimlessly with the singular goal of vengeance, his final steps led to the Rift known as the labyrinth. Although many eras have since passed, he continues to wander about to complete his age-old quest for vengeance.
Sub_Story_302202716=She wasn't always like this. These days, however, she is borderline obsessive. Whenever she had a question about something, she followed it through until she got an answer. And she often succeeded. One of the things that she grew most curious about was lifespans. And it was around that time... People began to call her a "witch."<br>After obsessively studying lifespans, Pamela was eventually rewarded with immortality. In celebration of her new birthday, she even hosted a lavish party. Of course, not many people attended.<br>While Pamela was both glad and relieved to find her answer, she was also somewhat sad. A;l those years, she had been driving by that one burning question. Then, she found another question to conquer when she happened to come across the labyrinth. The endless space of the labyrinth was very intriguing for her. She wanted to explore it. However, the labyrinth did not allow it, and gradually corroded her. Frightened, Pamela fled the labyrinth right away.<br>The mystery of the labyrinth ended up becoming a nasty hobby of hers instead, for many years to follow. Pamela began lying to people to find the answers in the endless space on her behalf. She would send the victim of her choice into the labyrinth on each of her birthdays, as a present to herself.<br>Unfortunately, Pamela still hasn't found the answer she's been looking for yet. Nobody had returned from the labyrinth. Thus, on her thousandth birthday, Pamela decides to become her own birthday present.
Sub_Story_102402725=She was coy yet haughty. Her every move suggested grace and sophistication. As an heiress to a fortune, she was never in want of anything. She always had the love of her family, and her life was filled with culture and sophistication. She even had the honor of recognized a top expert in the field of Rift research, an area often referred to as the Arke race's field of study. Then, one day, it all came crumbling down because of a man.<br>He gave off a warm first impression to her. His speech was comforting. His actions were kind and considerate. He was big for an Arkean. Big enough to possibly protect her, always. And thus, Luery grew dangerously quickly enamored with Venti. However, her advances never seemed to really get to Venti, who continued to push her away. This drove her crazy.<br>And as Luery's obsessive clinging continued, Venti decided to leave the Rift Research Society and go back to his hometown, giving up his dream. No matter how much she tried, Luery could not comprehend why Venti would leave her. Eventually, she concludes that there must be another woman back in Venti's hometown. Her pride could not allow Venti to just leave her like that. She couldn't bear to lose him to anyone else. So, she pushed Venti into the labyrinth.<br>And later, Luery also trapped herself in the labyrinth, forever wandering around in search of Venti. She mistakenly believes that she'll be eternally happy in there, as long as she can find Venti...
Sub_Story_102402735=The oldest of three, Venti was a responsible, masculine young Arkean who strived to keep his family fed ever since he was a child. He continued his studies on the Rift while taking care of his siblings. Thanks to his efforts, he lands a job at the Rift Research Society headed by Luery.<br>However, Venti wasn't actually talented enough to be hired alongside all his siblings. It was only possible, thanks to his masculine yet kind personality, which won over Luery's heart. This also marked the start of a great misfortune that would strike Venti in the future.<br>Falling in love at first sight with Venti, Luery begins to actively court him. However, to Venti, Luery was only the head of the Rift Research Society. Nothing more, nothing less. As an heiress to a fortune, Luery always got what she wanted. Rejection was an unfamiliar concept to her. Venti found Luery increasingly burdensome, which only worsened her obsession over him. Fearing for his own safety, Venti quit his job at the Rift Research Society to return to his hometown. However, as Luery refused to let him leave her, he ends up being abandoned in the depths of the Rift.<br>Although he tries to return to his siblings, he fails to find the exit. He succumbs to Rift poisoning and ends up wandering throughout the Rift forever.
Sub_Story_102402744=Since its days as a tadpole, Croak had always been an ambitious amphibian living in the mountain valley of Dudrin City. It dreamed of becoming the best singer of the frog world, croaking about from morning till evening. Although many humans threatened to kill it for being too noisy, Croak never gave up.<br>One day, the Rift opened up in front of Croak and sucked it in. The ribbiting frog just suddenly vanished. By the time Croak came to, it was no longer a happy little frog with shiny skin due to the exposure to the Rift energy. Finding itself alone in an unfamiliar environment, Croak sang its heart out to express its fear and sorrow.<br>After days of crying like that, Croak discovered that other frogs that were lost in the Rift had converged around him. The Rift Warp had empowered Croak's voice, which had a healing effect on wounded frogs. And thus, the frogs began to follow Croak.<br>The frogs formed a group with Croak as the leader, who was delighted to be so loved by all.
Sub_Story_102402754=Warblin was the leader of a band of goblin thieves which pillaged the towns around the Weiss Basin in Enova. Due to its aggressiveness and ruthless behavior, Warblin was feared by travelers and hated by the villagers. In response, the dwarvish commander Duprian leads an army to purge the goblin bandits.<br>The operations went swiftly, nearly wiping out the entire band in no time. Once feared in Weiss Basin, Warblin was now at death's door.<br>It was then that Luery appeared before Warblin. She offers to save Warblin and the surviving members of the band on one condition that they guard her secret vault. Warblin accepts and takes shelter with the rest of the thieves in the Rift.<br>Later, Warblin discovers that Duprian personally led the purge after being urged by Luery. Enraged at the deception, Warblin begins a revolt.
Sub_Story_102402763=Although it mostly handled chores at the band of thieves, this goblin once dreamed of dominating the Weiss Basin. However, it readily abandoned that dream when it barely survived Duprian's purge of the goblin thieves. It now works at the secret vault instead, putting its janitorial skills to great use.
Sub_Story_102402773=This ferocious goblin used to lead the looting and pillaging at the front lines when it served in the band of goblin thieves led by Warblin. It was gravely wounded during Duprian's purge of the goblins, but it barely survived, thanks to Luery's help. Since then, it has pledged total submission to Luery, and has been guarding her secret vault. It's currently very satisfied with its guard duty, which poses much less risk than working in the band of thieves. It's been telling everyone about how it loves is uniform.
Sub_Story_102402783=One of the survivors among the band of goblin thieves led by Warblin. Although it was captured and jailed by Duprian, it was released when Luery paid off its huge bail. It strives to pay off its debt, but it's disgruntled since the debt never seems to be get any smaller, despite all the payments.<br>It later learns that Duprian's purge of the goblins was carried out at Luery's urging and shares the discovery with Warblin, sparking off a revolt.
Sub_Story_102402792=This frog was fated to wander and die when it was sucked into a Rift that just happened to open nearby. However, thanks to the song of the Archmage Croak, it had been healed of the Rift toxins and it's become somewhat sentient.
Sub_Story_102402802=This frog was once fated to die soon in some mage's laboratory. However, it luckily escaped the lab, only to be sucked into the Rift while fleeing. Although it almost dies again in the Rift, the singing of Croak healed it of Rift poisoning and emotional distress. This is one lucky frog.
Sub_Story_102402812=This frog originally resided in Pandemonium. It was summoned to the MU continent because of a deal with a black mage. It was then that it became somewhat sentient. It almost dies when it unluckily gets sucked into the Rift. The singing of Croak heals it of Rift poisoning, saving its life. It later uses its experience in being summoned by using the Rift energy to summon other frogs as well.
Sub_Story_102402822=A treasure chest once cherished by Luery. Some of these were affected by the Rift energy as they were left unattended in the secret vault in the Rift for a long time. These mimics became living creatures, wreaking havoc due to the Rift Warp. The goblin guards always have a tough time, trying to rein in these chests.
Sub_Story_102402831=This was a high-end jelly sold at Francois, the best bakery in Ohrdor. But when no one bought it until it passed the expiration date, it was thrown away into the Rift. There, the Rift energy grants it sentience, turning it into the most powerful jelly in the world.
Sub_Story_102402841=Very Squishy Jelly was a jelly that was tossed into the Rift. When the Rift energy granted it sentience, it became aware of the gravity of pollution in the Rift. It hopes to prevent other victims from sharing its experience. It aspires to become a jelly environmental activist.
Sub_Story_102402851=This innocent mushroom has no idea what a frightening, dangerous place it was born in. Guarded by the shady forest and feeding off the nutrients of rotten logs, this mushroom began to think and changed little by little. Eventually, it even became capable of walking on two feet. While the Rift energy began to mutate its body, this innocent mushroom still doesn't understand that those changes aren't normal.
Sub_Story_102402861=Extended exposure to the Rift energy led certain parts of the locking mechanism of Luery's Secret Vault to transform until they finally became moving lifeforms. Luery kept these as pets since they didn't cause much trouble.
Sub_Story_102402871=Extended exposure to the Rift energy led certain parts of the locking mechanism of Luery's Secret Vault to transform until they finally became moving lifeforms. This allowed the vault doors to open easily, which then led the discontent Warblin and the other goblin thieves to steal treasure as part of their revolt.
Main_Story_201903006=I will return the glory of Walkreeger empire! A glory that will not fall! All beings will kneel before the Drakans, before me!
Main_Story_101103016=I will burn all order in this world and leave nothing but chaos!
Main_Story_101103026=Stop, evil one. Crystal rock altar is not for the likes of you.
Sub_Story_203002246=Kylops, a pair magic weapon, was designed only for the total destruction of everything on earth. This bizarre gathering of technology and metal of devildom walks on all fours which consists of legs almost as large as the pillars of buildings, and even larger arms which are equipped with a magic engine that makes sinister sounds, and tries to prove its only reason for existing.<br><br>Kylops red is a machine specialized for single or localized destruction, and performs the role of tracking and pulverizing a specific target.<br>The red core attached on the head is like the eyes of the predator that blazes between fog which is stained with darkness, and the two magic bumps that gush blazing red magic aura accurately detects the target it has to destroy in the battlefield.<br><br>When a target is limited, all the functions and powers of this cruel magic weapon start moving only for pulverizing it. Nobody can get away from the mad pursuit of Kylops red. Of course, the person could stay ahead if he is fast enough, but not forever.<br>It will destroy anything in its path, and smash the body of the target until it couldn't be recognized with its massive arms.<br><br>So I announced to the pitiful one who became the target of Kylops red. Don't struggle to extend that thin, petty life. All you'll get from picking those feet heavy with fear will be ragged breaths of panting and the pain of a crazily beating  heart. However, if you still has a piece of wisdom left, just let the inevitable results happen.
Sub_Story_203002256=Kylops, a pair magic weapon, was designed only for the total destruction of everything on earth. This bizarre gathering of technology and metal of devildom walks on all fours which consists of legs almost as large as the pillars of buildings and even larger arms which is equipped with magic engine that makes sinister sounds, and tries to prove its only reason for existing.<br><br>Kylops blue is specialized for destruction over a large area, and strike the target or area which it can apply heavy damage quantitatively.<br>The blue core surrounded by ferocious blue power of magic is forever seeking the place where it can cause the most terrible results and the two magic bumps that consist of magic energy is always prepared to summon a new magic weapon at its position.<br><br>When the target and area is confirmed, this cold magic weapon utilizes all of its resources to start scorching the earth. It brandishes the iron arms that move with magical power forcefully and destroys everything that it hits, and summons enormous amounts of magic weapons which no one knows where they are being made to aim for total destruction.<br>As the famine surpasses imagination afar, it almost causes an illusion that oneself is getting divine punishment for some irreversible and incomprehensible wrong.<br><br>So I will tell this  to the pitiful one on the battlefield of Kylops blue. Realize that all sadness and regrets for those who were left are meaningless. For nothing will be left on the battleground. Isn't it too futile to say 'that's left' pointing at the ripped bodies and lost souls. As you're just another being that will perish on that doomed land, best that you befriend that despair and throw yourself into resignation.
Sub_Story_201903006=Quadro couldn't believe the words coming out from the king's mouth. He believed that there would orders to prepare troops to defeat those hateful Nobles' alliance. And planned to widen our own forces at that opportunity once again.<br>But then, he says negotiations. This was just giving up the pride of the great Drakans. He didn't secretly get the Nobles' alliance into this for such stupid results.<br><br>It was unbearable. He couldn't serve that coward on the throne as king any longer. Now, the mission to lighten the strong future of Drakans was on himself, and under that noble purpose he granted justification and indulgence to all actions by himself.<br><br>He recalled the plans one by one.<br>Leader of Drakan knights, Chaisong. It was reckless to stand face-to-face against him. Then how to exclude him. Yes, by abducting the prince he was escorting and framing him for it. The prince would come in handy as hostage in an emergency.<br>Use the Drakans first to take care of the king. It will be enough to cause confusion. Stabbing the heart of the coward was surely his duty.<br>The Drakans will take care of those who came by Luiziane falls. He went through the hardships of taking care of those who have been dumped by prince Ungpam because he expected something like this. It seems a little short, but the goblins who are filling in could buy a little time and that should be all right.<br>Finally, for chaos crystal. Taking the infinite power from it to make all beings surrender to the Drakans. The precious essence of the dragon king Kaizel will be enough to dissolve the chaos crystal. As all this was to pull up the Drakans once again to a higher place, the ancestors should forgive and help him as well.<br>Finishing his thoughts, Quadro ordered a servant to get his robe and magic tools. After equipment, the servant asked. 'It's been a while for the robes and magic tools. Is there anything wrong?' Without a word, Quadro reached out his hand to the servant. With a flash from the end of it, the servant disappeared without so much as a scream.<br>Quadro recited in low voice, 'Your extinction will also be for the great Drakans. So be proud of it.'
Sub_Story_101103016=Everyone wants a stronger power, and that goes the same for immortal beings as well. As this was an irresistible instinct for a being with will and soul, the desire itself couldn't be blamed. However, it may be possible to judge right from wrong by the means used to satisfy that desire.<br><br>At the end of the desire for power, Valtheram reached the conclusion of 'order means restrictions.' All things are ruled by order, and it seemed disgusting to live and die within it. No matter how great the achievement, it was only just touching the edge of order. Fishes cannot fly no matter how much they struggle, and birds cannot burrow into the ground.<br><br>But when he accepted the power of demon god Sekneum, he felt his limits disappear. His body became stronger, and the horn grew horribly. The flames rose high enough to vaporize clouds, and the heat almost seemed to melt the earth. A power that exceeds the limit. Evolution unlike any other changes. The true freedom that Valtheram desired belonged to the demon god Sekneum, and the price was corruption, but it didn't matter to Valtheram who has already thrown away order.<br><br>As long as he existed, all the orders in the world was at the risk of burning away to nothing.
Sub_Story_101103026=Crystal rock altar is a holy place where Vulcan's oracles came down, and ancient Drakans received divine revelation to make their civilization and history at this place. Vulcan's oracle hasn't been made since the fall of the Walkreeger empire, but this place will always remain as the sanctuary of Drakans.<br><br>Epiaros is the guardian dragon that guards this holy altar. He is kind to the good ones that approach the altar, but is merciless to those that approach with the wrong purpose and mind. The reason that the crystal rock altar could stay firm in the difficult history of Drakans was the protection of Epiaros. This altar is not just a place but the proof that god was protecting Drakans, so all Drakans pay gratitude and respect to Epiaros, who guards this place firmly.<br><br>Through the aeons, Epiaros has become a being with nothing left but the blue dragon bones shining with holy light. This means that he denied death, the ending for all living things, but it doesn't mean that he has become evil. The will and pledge of Epiaros to guard the altar forever is the proof of the miracle that comes before the laws of life and death.<br><br>Unless Epiaros himself breaks the pledge, the holy dragon bones will never lose its holy light and fall.
Sub_Story_102603035=The politics of Drapia is largely divided into kingship and the Senate. The Senate decides on matters of the state, and the king gives the final approval. Of course, the king has the right to veto, then the Senate will work on the matters again on the king's opinion.<br>As the king and the Senate are in check and supplement each other, it is not an overstatement to say that the chairman of Senate is 'the 2nd king'.<br>Chairman Quadro had the faith to make a strong Drapia, and went on to process various policies and matters energetically even at his not-so-young age, and this made a synergy with the king Kazelhike who focused on arms and prince Ungpam who dreamed of a stronger Drakans.<br>Then one day, prince Ungpam made reinforced troops called Drakans using pactra, the technology of Kantur without the king's permission, and claimed that they should begin war against Kantur. Of course, making a strong Drapia wasn't a wrong thought, but Ungpam's claims were certainly crossing the line and laws, and as a result king Kazelhike ordered exile of Ungpam, against the desperate advice of chairman Quadro.<br>It was as if the one wheel on a carriage which was rolling extraordinarily well suddenly broke. The carriage named Drapia inevitably stopped, and Drakans were bewildered at the sudden situation and changed policies. But as with everything else, with time everybody adapted and went back to their everyday lives.<br>But, chairman Quadro couldn't, and didn't choose to. He didn't even think so. His only plan and mind was to make Drapia and Drakans greater. Unable to running was just temporary. He could still walk slowly.<br>But at the same time, he realized one thing. It was that the next time he fell, he would never be able to move again.<br>Quadro made a resolution. That he will break any obstacle in his way. Whatever it may be. And... Whoever.
Sub_Story_102603045=Walkreeger empire once prospered with power and culture that dominated all of Littenberg. But getting absorbed in its own power, it weakened, and faded into history by the darkness missionaries who seized the opportunity.<br>This tale wouldn't be complete without that of 'the dragon knight.' These great and strong warriors who were armed with loyalty to the empire and respect for the dragon defeated the enemies of the empire with the might of the dragons. But when something falls, the aftermath is in proportion with its greatness. The corruption of dragon knight designed by the plot of darkness missionaries was the finishing blow to the fall of the empire.<br>Thehe trigger of this finishing blow was the dragon knight Salkres, whose name was recorded in history as the 'first corrupt dragon knight'.<br>It seems that at first, Salkres himself accepted the spells of darkness in pure pursuit of power. Would have boasted that he couldn't lose with the grace of dragon that he had. Wouldn't have acknowledged that he was being consumed. All who were stained by corruption became the prey of darkness in such way.<br>At some point, Salkres became the loyal servant of darkness and spread the spell of darkness like plague to those around him, and the dragon knights fell to that plague one by one. And when such corruption that spread touched dragon king Kaizel, the fate of Walkreeger empire reached its ending.<br><br>Of course, it is clear that the main reason for the fall of Walkreeger empire was due to their own arrogance. But if not for Salkres, or if he didn't accept the spell of darkness, dragon knights could have been the glimmer of hope, and that glimmer could have burnt the darkness. Because dragon knights had such powers.<br>But there is no 'if' in history. Only the record that 'the first corrupt dragon knight' stalled the final hope of Walkreeger remains.
Sub_Story_102603054=Zrataken had a noble mission to guard the sanctuary of the sealed dragon knight as the descendant of Walkreeger empire. He loyally and perfectly carried out his duty for a long time. To welcome the end that will come one day, guarding the sanctuary with other managers. He believed that  it was his fate.<br><br>But it didn't take long for that faith to turn. The followers of darkness deluded him. They told him that he would remain a simple undertaker with such might, and to seize the world with the power within that sanctuary. Now Zrataken made his refusal clear by not forgiving those who sweet-talked to him.<br><br>But a small stone can rock the lake. Zrataken was moved by a single word of those races  and couldn't be satisfied with his mission any longer. Guarding the sanctuary became a bore. He blankly stared at the holy place, wondering what he was doing. He made more and more mistakes in the everyday duties.<br><br>The other managers of the sanctuary were doubtful of his actions, but thought he'll be the same soon. Everybody falters once in a while. As he would become much stronger and tougher by overcoming that weakness, everyone believed Zrataken would overcome the temptation and anguish and carry out his mission.<br><br>But that trust turned out futile and all the managers were betrayed of that trust.<br><br>As always, the strange group poured evil spells and mind attacks on the sanctuary. Even though the attack was fierce, the ancient sealing wouldn't be unlocked by such and there were many mistakes made by the strange group so they guessed they will tire out eventually, as always. Then, Zrataken made his move. Zrataken unlocked the sealing which he was managing with the key of the  sanctuary, and like a small hole tears down the whole bank, the sealing was neutralized immediately. The managers fell one by one at the sudden wave of the enemies' attack.<br><br>Looking at the fellow managers with cold, maddened eyes, Zrataken walked on to the deep parts of the sanctuary. His mind was already full of greed for power.
Sub_Story_102603064='King of Drapia Kazelhike's second son, Briant had all the talents fit for a prince, but there were some doubts for him to be the leader of the brave and aggressive Drakans as he was tender and soft in nature. The people's opinion was the same, and they said 'he would make a good, nice king, but can he fight?'   Briant himself wasn't after the throne, and thought that trusting and following his proud brother and father would be well enough.<br><br>However, the following huge events led Briant's life to a very unexpected fate.<br>Prince Ungpam was exiled for a case that was close to treason, then was corrupted by the hands of Nobles' alliance and devildom, and finally met his own death. Also, due to the assassination of the king by chairman Quadro, Briant was suddenly made king. Losing both his proud brother and father was a tremendous matter for Briant himself, as was to Drapia to lose all of the top leaders of the nation, a true chaos, in other words.<br><br>Anyone would have wanted to run away, but Briant did not withdraw from such situation. He was a proud descendant of the royalty  and displayed the true nature of Vulcan's creation. He had the personality and ability to carry the huge burden of bringing peace to Drapia. He made his way by himself, and tried to make a steady new future for Drapia.<br><br>At least, it is not a powerful force that is needed in the confusion of Drapia, but healing and stability. And nobody could doubt that Briant was the suitable leader who could give those two things.
Sub_Story_102703073=Lemuria was smart among the smart ones since childhood, but she concealed it because she felt burdened by showing her abilities and for the evaluation of other people. But talent will show itself. Kundun Memphis, the ruler of Media principality, found out her potential at a glance, and immediately made her his best disciple. In such situation, Lemuria could no longer conceal her abilities, and started to spread her wings. Everyone who saw her agreed that she will become a great magician one day, sometime in the future.<br><br>One extraordinary thing was that she did not go independent, and remained to be a disciple of Kundun. Although it was common for magicians and scholars to become independent and head on their own academic ways, separated from their masters, once they are recognized by their masters or prove their skill has reached certain level. The same goes for the masters, as it was considered as a kind of a medal to have a large number of pupils to leave the master and become independent. But even though she proved her abilities and knowledge more than enough, she still remained as the best pupil of Kundun.<br><br>Of course, people could guess why she wouldn't leave Kundun. No, they were sure. If anyone saw how she looked at Kundun, how she talked about him, or how her eyes changed at such words, it wasn't hard to guess her feelings toward him. However, the only regretful thing is that the very person who should be aware of such looks and feelings had no idea at all.
Sub_Story_102703083=Kundun's disciple, Karon is surely a talented and skilled person. His achievements sometimes astonished his master, the unparalleled great magician, and he also have the sense of responsibility to accomplish whatever was the mission. Karon seems to be carrying out his missions diligently, and that he will soon become independent from Kundun.<br><br>But Kundun had other thoughts. Kundun also agreed that Karon is a very capable person. On the contrary, not only was he great, he thought that he had the best talent among his pupils. But he thinks that Karon's achievements do not match the talents that Karon has.<br><br>This is the reason why Kundun doesn't approve of Karon's independence. For an  ordinary level, Karon would have become independent long ago, but Kundun is sure that Karon could present better results, and he wouldn't let him go unless he showed it. Surely, another reason was that no one else fulfilled his instructions as accurately as Karon. Like a secretary who knows exactly what he wanted, so to speak.<br><br>Anyway, today as always, Karon keeps his unspeakable irritation to himself, and is keeping himself busy to follow the strange and rambling orders of Kundun.
Sub_Story_102603093=History is a huge flow made up of all the causes and results made by people living in the same period. But regretfully, not all could record their stories, so only the names of those with the most important responsibilities get recorded. For instance, the name of the 'king'.<br><br>Drapia made well enough development in the reign of king Kazelhike and especially for military power, made aggressive progress with prince Ungpam and Quadro, the chairman of Senate. If this continued, he would have been remembered as the great king who elevated the national power of Drapia.<br><br>But prince Ungpam, who received high expectation, was exiled due to organizing illegal reinforced troops and making absurd remarks about making war. To make matters worse, there were the rise of darkness missionaries and devildom army, rebellion of Drakans who were followers of Ungpam, and attack of the Nobles' alliance.<br><br>In such chaotic situation, Kazelhike invested all resources to settle and stabilize the current situations as he couldn't carry on with the existing policies. This was a wise decision of course, but it caused the separation with the chairman Quadro, who had the ambition of having 'a strong Drakans'.<br><br>As a result, his ending was in vain. The friend of yesterday who pursued the same purpose turned to be today's enemy and stabbed him, and so his grand dreams flew away with his blood. In this way, Kazelhike, who may have made a sage king, disappeared behind history as a tragic king.

Index_1000=After his plans for Duelden were thwarted, Zakarian, the leader of the Dark Mission, summoned his high-ranking members to discuss other ways to stir up the MU continent. Before their meeting began, Zakarian suggested that they use Neria's Tears, the legacy of the Creator Akneria that were scattered everywhere across the continent. Starting with the Neria's Tears hidden in Litenberg, he wanted to steal and operate all the Neria's Tears on the continent, ultimately to summon the dragons, the executioners of Akneria. However, some members didn't agree with Zakarian's suggestion, and the most vocal of them all was Belgaterm, who once proposed soul corruption and corpse reanimation to cause confusion in Duelden.<br><br>Belgaterm argued that using Akneria's legacy contradicted their cult's doctrines, which denied the existence of the Creator. Belgaterm wasn't popular within the Mission at that time. One of his proposed operations in Duelden had gone awry because of a Contract Knight, and the others weren't happy with that. His objection was received with scoffs from Zakarian and the others. After the meeting, Belgaterm realized that no one in the Dark Mission would listen to him and decided to take matters into his own hands. He left the Mission, sneaked into the Sanctum of Dragon Knights in the Wallkreiger Ruins in Litenberg, and corrupted the spirits of the members of the ancient kingdom in the center of the Sanctum, causing chaos in the area.<br><br>Meanwhile, Zakarian was free to proceed with his plan to steal the Neria's Tears in Litenberg, now that Belgaterm had left and no one else dared to oppose him. In the end the Dark Mission stole the Neria's Tears and used them in the Closed Waterway, summoning dragons everywhere in Litenberg and stirring up the entire continent as planned. But after a while, a Contract Knight came from Duelden and joined forces with Dracans Knight Commander Chaisong to retrieve the Neria's Tears in the Closed Waterway. Zakarian sent out Kisellos, one of his high-ranking priestesses who attained a great magic power in an arctic region, to stop them, but to no avail.<br>
Index_1001=After the Three-year War, the Karol Kingdom fell and its queen Lenavis died, leaving the rest of the kingdom's population in need of a new leader. But because most members of the Karol Royal Family were killed by the Demons that invaded its palace during the Three-year War, it was very difficult to find a legitimate successor to the throne. But later it became known that a remote descendant of the Tephakin Family was alive, that once produced a regent for the kingdom, and the people decided to elect him as their leader and start a new country in the form of a dukedom named after his family. <br><br>Fortunately for them, their first Archduke, Ion Tephakin, was a born politician. On his inauguration day, which was also the foundation day of the Tephakin Dukedom, Ion announced that this new country would carry on the legacy of the old Karol Kingdom. To prove that, he would find the Lightbringer, a national treasure that disappeared along with Queen Lenavis. His first announcement struck a chord with the people who missed their old kingdom, and Ion instantly became popular. But despite his political prowess, Ion Tephakin was not a perfect man. <br><br>He and his wife had a daughter, Kali Tephakin, the current official successor to the dukedom. However, he also had a secret affair with a palace maid named Rena, and the two had a daughter, Iope Tephakin, who's been wandering the bordering areas because of his legitimate daughter, Kali. He hid the fact that he had a lovechild for as long as he could, and just before his death, he revealed it to his closest confidant, Commander Joseph. Ion also asked Joseph to give the sheath of the Lightbringer that he had to Iope and to protect her and her mother. <br><br>While he was alive, Ion searched for the Lightbringer and could only find its sheath. He must have wanted to show his people the complete Lightbringer: he didn't tell anyone except Joseph that he'd found its sheath until he died. And thus, at the time of his death, only Commander Joseph knew about his lovechild, Iope, and that she had the sheath for the most valuable sword in the land. He didn't like it, but he couldn't ignore his late master's last wish. He brought Iope to Kali and pleaded with her to treat Iope as an official member of the Royal Family.<br><br>At first, Kali had a hard time accepting her father's dark secret, but soon she embraced it and accepted Iope as her sister. But when people started asking who was going to succeed the throne, Joseph supported Kali but didn't tell her that her father gave the Lightbringer's sheath to her sister, worrying about possible bloodshed. At that time, it was widely known that Joseph, the commander of the dukedom was Iope's guardian and his support for Kali disappointed the forces who wanted to put Iope on the throne. <br><br>But it was understandable why Joseph made such a decision: Solon, the commander of the Tephakin Army back then, was supporting Kali. If Joseph declared his support for Iope, both he and Iope could have been accused of treason and executed. Time went by, and Kali became the official successor to the dukedom, but no one knows how having two successors might affect the future of their country. <br>
Index_1002=Currently, the Dracans Knights are moving as one under the command of their leader Chaisong to help their vice-captain Kainan who was just released from his long captivity with someone who brainwashed him. After Kainan was defeated by some Contract Knight in the depths of the Prison Camp, Kundun, the MU continent's greatest mage of the century, released him from the spell that controlled his mind and body. However, Kainan has been experiencing constant hallucinations and headaches ever since then, probably from overexerting himself in his fight with the Contract Knight and because of the spell that had controlled him for a long time.<br><br>Chaisong looked for various ways to help his vice-captain and found out there may be a solution in Dracansor, a temple that ancient Dracans built to cultivate Dracans Knights. So he and his elite members tried to pass the last stage of Dracansor several times, but to no avail. Immediately after Kainan returned, Chaisong took him to Kundun for his treatment, but even the MU continent's greatest mage couldn't help him. Feeling desperate, Chaisong went to the Dracanem Elder Council for help. Council Chairman Quadro told him that maybe he could find a solution from the Dracans Ancient Knowledge sealed in the last stage of Dracansor.<br><br>He added that Dracansor consisted of three sections, and the huge area by the entrance was used for Dracans who had just come of age. There, the instructors of the Dracans Knights trained their young recruits to become Knights like them. In the center of the area stood the temple building where the recruits would be tested for their worthiness to join the Knights. The temple itself was small, almost abnormally so compared to the huge area. This was because it simply served as the entrance to the large natural cave underneath, which was discovered during the time of the ancient Wallkreiger Kingdom. So to see the full extent of Dracansor, one must enter the temple and go down below through the gigantic passageway connected to the heart of Dracansor. <br><br>Dracans, when they came of age to become Dracans Knights, must take tests in different sections of the giant natural cave and submit proof that they passed these tests. The fact that only a handful of Dracans join the Knights every year proves the difficulty of these tests. Ancient Dracans divided the cave into several stages to create an effective training center for their youth, and it seemed even Commander Chaisong, who is praised as the greatest Dracans Knight in history, failed to conquer the last stage.<br><br>Sometimes when he'd get drunk, Chaisong would talk about his experience in the cave. According to him, Dracansor is a hellish battlefield filled with monsters that come pouring out of gaping Rifts and members of local tribes trying to protect their homes against these otherworldly invaders. And certain stages of Dracansor have some sort of antechamber in which Dracans who came through different entrances meet. There, they must fight each other, because only a certain number of contestants are allowed to move farther.
Index_1003=Before the actual invasion of Earth, the Pandemonium Army commanders gathered in one place and sought effective ways to seize victory. Orman, the master of temptation, first suggested a ploy to distract the army of Earth. He said that they should persuade the Goblins in Enova to awaken Glasha who was sealed deep inside a mine by the Allied Forces during the Three-year War. In the meantime, he would also recruit the ancient Garuda tribe in Duelden and invade the Tephakin Dukedom of the Heraus Coalition with them. The Goblins and the Garudas were indispensable for this diversionary operation of Orman, and he was going to tempt them by offering what they'd wanted. The Goblins always had been considered inferior among the Demons, and they weren't happy with this. Orman would promise them an increase in social status in return for their cooperation.<br><br>But in the end, they were just pawns in his game. Once they successfully awakened Glasha, he wasn't going to care if they were killed by the once notorious tyrant of Pandemonium, or were wiped out by the Allied Forces. The Garudas were a noble tribe of low-ranking deities created by Akneria. After she perished during the Divine War, they had lost most of their homeland to the Tephakin Dukedom and lived in the freezing borderlands of Northern Duelden. For them, Orman was going to offer their land back, but once he conquered Duelden, he was going to get rid of them. They would have been too weakened by the fight with the Tephakins to resist him.<br><br>The next proposal was put forward by Elyraq, who spread the Evil Energy on Earth. He suggested that they move a large number of forces to the earthly realm to prepare for their invasion, and then intensify the Evil Energy spread everywhere on Earth to create Evil Energy Tunnels between Pandemonium and Earth. According to Elyraq's extensive research into the earthly realm, the Kanturians' Pectra Energy was the most effective tool to intensify the Evil Energy and they could obtain this energy through Prince Woongpam, a member of the Drapia Royal Family who was exiled after being caught experimenting on his own kind to make himself powerful. These two commanders' proposals were unanimously accepted, and they set about carrying out their plans.<br>
Index_1004=After Zakarian's plan for the Litenberg continent failed and the two greatest rivals on Earth, the Heraus Coalition and the Line Alliance, joined forces with each other to fight their common enemies, the Pandemonium Legion and the Dark Mission, Zakarian felt cornered and turned his attention to the Noria continent where he once had a firm footing. Once known as the Elven Sage, Zakarian still had a following in Noria that was big enough to help him turn the continent upside down.<br><br>For a start, he had his firm supporters, the Dark Elves, feed Noria false information, convincing the regular Elves that the Ashas were after Ethedrean. The panicked Elves transformed the World Tree into a gigantic bio weapon, forcing the Ashas to respond to their provocation in kind, setting up military forces along the borders that they shared with the Elves in readiness for war. But then some Contract Knight arrived in Noria from Litenberg and thwarted Zakarian's scheme. So, he ordered the Dark Elves to storm the Ashas' Ancient Castle of the Pioneers with the Dark Shadows and make it look like the Elves' retaliation for having their sanctum, Sapientia Temple, raided by the Ashas.<br><br>Zakarian was trying to drive a wedge between these two nations, who had now detected a third party's intervention in their dispute and were considering reconciliation with each other. He also wanted to get rid of the Contract Knight who was on the way to the castle to stop him. By the time the Contract Knight arrived at the castle, Zakarian had the Dark Mission resurrect Pabillune with black magic, but the Contract Knight defeated the ancestor of the Ashas and crushed his plan before it could take flight.<br>
Index_1005=Baraex was one of the scientists stationed in Restricted Area 6-1, a secret research lab created by the Ashas in an effort to resist Noria's superb manatech. He had an Ashas mother and a Kanturian father and showed talent in science early on, thanks to his father's genes that enabled his kind to excel in science. The Ashas government took notice of his talent and sent him out to Area 6-1 as soon as he came of age, and Baraex was the youngest member in history to join Area 6-1. Every member of Area 6-1 was a talented scientist in their own right, but none of them was as good as Baraex, and they resented him for that. <br><br>Of all these jealous scientists, Kunan was the most malicious, and he was a senior member of the lab. He picked on every single thing Baraex did, and things came to a head when he learned that Aria, a female member of the lab and the subject of his secret crush, was secretly in love with Baraex. His sense of superiority as a pure-blood Ashas was already crushed by Baraex, and knowing that the woman he loved was in love with some mongrel sent him into an immense rage. This is what eventually turned Area 6-1 into the forbidden zone that it is now. <br><br>Kunan used his authority to summon Aria to the unfrequented mutant spore research lab and confronted her about being so protective of Baraex. Aria told him off, and Kunan lost it. He pushed her roughly, and she hit the row of mutant spore test tubes behind her, breaking them as she fell. The broken test tubes released mutant spores into the air, and everyone, except Kunan and some lab members who were outside at the time, was infected with the spores that turned them into monsters. Area 6-1 has been under quarantine since then. <br><br>
Index_1006=At the end of the First Divine War, the Creator Akneria fought the Demon God Sekneum and sustained a fatal injury. Having sensed her impending doom, she used every ounce of life force left in her to revive the fallen members of the armies of the Heavens and Earth so they could turn the tables on their enemy, the Pandemonium Army. With her sacrifice, the Allied Forces recovered their strength and won their last battle against their enemy, and Akneria disappeared into the air like tendrils of smoke, having exhausted all her life force. Her body remained on Earth for a while, but soon it disintegrated, turning into big crumbling chunks of crystal.<br><br>Meanwhile, right after they won their battle against the Pandemonium Army, the Allied Forces faced a new problem: the dragons called Akneria's Executioners. These dragons were a kind of agent that Akneria created to avoid intervening directly in earthly matters, and each of them was as strong as a low-ranking god. Akneria controlled their minds to keep them from abusing their power. And when she perished, the dragons were released from her control and started going on a rampage, destroying the earthly realm. <br><br>It was getting more difficult to control these dragons that were setting the land ablaze wherever they went. Then, the Heavens Army experienced a strange phenomenon while transporting Akneria's crystallized body: dragons came flying toward her body as if they were attracted to it. Rugard, the commander of the Heavens Army at that time, immediately decided to divide her body into several pieces and move them to remote areas far away from any civilization, so that the dragons would fly away to the closest fragment of Akneria they could detect and stay with it. <br><br>The armies of the Heavens and Earth named these crystals that once formed their Creator's body "Neria's Tears". They swore that they would remember her noble sacrifice forever.
Index_1007=Day 00, Year 00. Bulcan, after learning the locations of all of Neria's Tears from Rugard, followed some angels to one of Neria's Tears in a cave in Litenberg. There, he discovered hundreds of humanoids in stasis form, with their gazes fixed on Neria's Tears. From the tremendous amount of energy that each of them radiated, it didn't take long for him to deduce that they were dragons.<br><br>Day 00, Year 00. An ancient dragon introduced itself as Kaizel and confessed that since the loss of Akneria after the Divine War, the spiritual connection that the dragons had with the Creator was broken. As a result, their minds started deteriorating rapidly, except for the few that Akneria personally released from the connection. After listening to this dragon, Bulcan reassured the anxious dragons that he'd find a solution for them.<br><br>Day 00, Year 00. Bulcan, several other gods who followed him, and Kaizel, the last of his kind to remain awake, studied for a long time and found a way to break the connection by using Neria's Tears. This method contained a few critical flaws. Kaizel, refusing to compromise with these flaws, declined Bulcan's offer to release him from the connection.<br><br>Day 00, Year 00. Kaizel left the cave with the others that were awake, but they were no longer dragons since they were released from the connection. Bulcan headed for a cave in Salormis, looking for another of Neria's Tears. After another long period of research, Bulcan found a way to use Neria's Tears in the Salormis cave. This method was completely different from the one he found in Litenberg. It was to create dragons that would also be known as the Executioners of the Creator.
Index_1008=Hour 00, Day 00, Year 00. At Chaisong's request, I dropped by the Dracans Knights' command center in Dracansor and met its commander, Master Knight Yakan. He addressed me as a brother and issued a permit to enter the Realm of Perseverance easily enough. It's probably because Chaisong asked him to treat me like he would treat him.<br><br>Hour 00, Day 00, Year 00. Ferandus, the first instructor I met in the Realm of Perseverance, said that visits from the supply units were becoming few and far between, and wondered if the situation was the same with the other defense bases. He stopped me to give a different mission. He asked me to recon the Chakuas stationed near the base and find out what they were up to.<br><br>Hour 00, Day 00, Year 00. After scouting the Chakuas' tightly guarded territory, I went to Anan, the second instructor I met in the defense base. Just like Ferandus, he was unhappy about how visits from the supply units were getting sparser. Anan called me for a new mission. He said the Dracans base up north was occupied by the invading Demons, Thrashers that came out of a Rift, and that a strange problem had occurred there.<br><br>Hour 00, Day 00, Year 00. The last Dracans Knights' defense base I visited was a shambles. Having run out of supplies a long time ago, the soldiers were in low spirits. They lay sprawled everywhere, groaning from the injuries received while trying to defend the base up north before it was occupied by the invading Demons that had come out of a Rift. I met a soldier in a corner of the Dracans base, where the air was still ringing with the sounds of clashing swords and spears. He said that something strange happened in the base before it was occupied by the Gremlins.<br><br>Hour 00, Day 00, Year 00. Instructor Zeren at the Gates of Glory said Master Knight Yakan headed out to the Realm of Perseverance with Quadro in tow. He had the impression that the Master Knight was being unusually impatient and had Quadro escorted by a group of soldiers as if he was a prisoner. Did Yakan plan all this? Something doesn't add up, though. Ominous thoughts swirl around in my head. I can't help but think I'm being used as a pawn in some elaborate scheme.
Index_1013=Finally, Muren discovers conclusive evidence in the Rift. The Arke Thieves that abducted the villagers on the culprit's behalf had a mask that looked like it belonged to one of the carnival troupe members. But his joy in finding the evidence doesn't last long.<br><br>Soon, he realizes discovering the mask was too easy. He doesn't believe the culprit accidentally left such an incriminating piece of evidence behind. It has to be a trap to lure him. He feels it in his bones. But it's the only lead he has for now. After much contemplation, he decides to confront the troupe members with the mask. If the culprit wants to play, then he's going to go along with it.<br><br>After a lot of legwork, he narrows the suspects down to three: Pereira, who makes and manages all the troupe members' masks, Erin, who's actually the owner of the mask, but claims she hasn't seen it for a long time, Echo, who has borrowed Erin's mask and gone missing. Each and every one of them seems equally suspicious.<br><br>Is the culprit among them? Muren focuses on even the smallest clue to identify the culprit.
Index_1014=Squee! *Gasp*"<br>Luery quickly covered her mouth to stop herself from squeeing like a little girl. But no one paid attention to her. They were just as surprised as she was. Their eyes were focused on Venti, who was smiling sheepishly.<br><br>When she first met Venti, Luery didn't think very much of him at all. He stuttered when he talked, and he was too timid for someone so big and tall. Picturing rolls of fat underneath the thick layers of clothes he was wearing, Luery grimaced and decided that Venti was just a slob.<br><br>But as they worked together as members of the Rift Research Society, her opinion of him started changing. He may stutter, but he never lied. He was reasoning was sound and logical when he researched. He was a considerate listener outside work. He may look timid, but he was always meticulous with his work, and strong enough to handle chores that required manhandling. At a certain point of time, even his face that usually looked unsure started looking cute to Luery. She tried to deny her feelings for him several times, but she couldn't stop herself from thinking about him all the time.<br><br>"L-Luery?" <br>"H-huh?"<br><br>Venti's voice brought her back to reality. She quickly withdrew her hand. For some reason, she was standing in front of him, her hand reaching out to touch his body that looked like a beautiful masterpiece of an ancient sculptor.<br><br>"Err... Well, that was great. I was so amazed."<br>"Hah, hah hah..."<br>"N-now, let's go swim. C-come on!"<br><br>No one could stop their hearts from beating so fast at the sight of him, but she wished she could. No matter how hard she tried, her heart kept fluttering, turning her face the same color as her hair. Wanting to hide her embarrassment, she dove into the sea before he did.<br><br>She has no intention of confessing her feelings for him first. It's unfair that such a beautiful and noble being like her has fallen in love with him. At the very least, she couldn't be the first to admit what she felt for him. Her pride would never allow that.<br>So, she's decided to make him confess first, by fair means or foul.<br>And when he does, she'd pretend as if she has no other choice but to accept him, as she gently leans against his big, muscular chest.
Index_1009=When Luery first founded the Rift Research Society at Dumpain's suggestion, things were rather different than now. With immense capital, Luery actively recruited talent to bring the Rift Research Society up to speed. As a result, talented but headstrong Arkeans mainly made up the team, leading them to often fight amongst themselves.<br><br>In order to address such issues, Luery hired Hyre and Ross. Unlike her younger brother Ross, Hyre wasn't actually talented enough to be recruited into the Rift Research Society. However, the way she would selflessly look after her brother was seen in a favorable light by Luery. As people witnessed how the Hyre-Ross siblings cared for each other, the members of the Rift Research Society began to learn the value of good relationships and their impact on teamwork.<br><br>Soon after this, Luery agreed to hire Grande and Tall alongside Venti as part of the recruiting deal. This move was also intended to foster a collaborative atmosphere in the Society.
Index_1010=Warblin is a mixed breed of Orik and Pamkuma goblins. Unwelcome in goblin society, it was branded with the mark of slaves on its forehead the moment it was born. It spent its adolescence persecuted by its master. Such trials led Warblin to build up a great grudge, which exploded one day - leading Warblin to murder its master and flee the goblin society.<br><br>After spending much time as a fugitive, Warblin hears of goblins in similar situations living in hiding, and decides to seek them out. Although it was exhausting, Warblin was delighted to search around for similar goblins. Finally, it succeeded in discovering a goblin town situated near the ridges of Weiss Basin.<br><br>However, Warblin's joy soon soured into disappointment. Having lived in hiding for so long, the mixed-breed goblins were unmotivated and believed themselves to be natural losers. Warblin could not accept this. Instead, it decides to raise up the community again.<br><br>After much time, Warblin's efforts led to the improvement in the self-appreciation of the mixed-breed goblins. With Warblin leading the way, the goblins decide to take revenge on the world for persecuting them. As their first move, they would start a band of thieves with Warblin as the leader.
Index_1011=Like always, Croak's singing filled Fabrice's Garden. Most of the garden's residents found comfort in the singing and went on with their lives. However, one frog was unhappy about the singing. This frustration soon leads to a serious event.<br><br>This discontented frog was the Bandit Frog. Bandit Frog said that it abhors Croak's singing as it rings throughout Fabrice's Garden, and claims to be a much better singer. Bandit Frog badmouthed Croak every day. The discovery that someone disliked its singing greatly shocks Croak, rendering it mute.<br><br>The residents of Fabrice's Garden discuss the matter and finally decide to grant Bandit Frog a chance to sing. Once the Bandit Frog started to sing, it only disappointed everyone in Fabrice's Garden. It turns out Bandit Frog is a terrible singer. Bandit Frog was so bad, Croak was immediately cured of its acute aphasia.
Index_1012=The Rift predators don't remember how long and why they had been wandering throughout the giant maze of the labyrinth. Their innermost desires and rage drove these predators to become killing machines.<br><br>Originally, these predators were once heroes who should have gone down in history, like the great emperor who united the continent or the knight who saved mankind from dragons. However, they suddenly disappeared from history when they were trapped inside the labyrinth, bound by its eternal fetters. It's not that they committed a grave sin to deserve this. Their reputation and capability were just seen as threatening, which was why they've been punished so severely.<br><br>The managers of time and dimensions weren't gods, but were nearly as powerful. However, even they feared humans who excelled beyond their brethren. These "heroes" sometimes demonstrated anomalies of power and strength, crossing lines that should not be crossed. Such incidents often affected the timelines the managers were responsible for, leading to great headaches. Enraged, the managers had the executors deceive the heroes and trap them in the labyrinth.<br><br>As can be seen, the labyrinth isn't just an infinite stretch of space after all. Also, the Rift predators are not mindless killers, but ordinary humans. Doomed to wander around aimlessly, the Rift predators need your help now more than ever to escape the eternal fetters of the labyrinth.
Index_1015=Your majesty, surely prince Ungpam stepped somewhat out of line. But it was all from the desire to make a stronger Drapia. You mustn't cast him away like this!"<br>Chairman of Senate, Quadro begged desperately, but couldn't change the decision of Kazelhike, king of Drapia. There are lines that shouldn't be crossed. Prince Ungpam crossed that line so far for him to remain as the successor to the  throne.<br>"Chairman Quadro. Do you think it was 'somewhat' in earnest? He tried to organize troops reinforced with pactra, without permission from myself, the king. And claimed that this is the reason to attack Kantur, do you think that makes sense?"<br>"Sire. That is..."<br>"Organizing troops without the king's permission is treason in itself. And tried to make war without cause. We are the great Drakans, creations of the god Vulcan and successors of the power of mighty dragons! What Ungpam claimed was like telling us to become a group of thieves! I can't help but feel disappointed as a king, as well as a father!"<br>"But...."<br>"Stop!"<br>"......."<br>"I will say this again. Prince Ungpam will be dethroned from this moment. Drakan knights shall detain Ungpam and his troops. Also, all who sides with Ungpam shall be accused of treason as well, no matter the reason, so let this be known to all of Drapia!"<br>On king Kazelhike's command, all the soldiers of Ungpam were imprisoned at the secret jail under watch by the  Drakan knights. Being of royal birth, Ungpam was excused from imprisonment, but still had to be under surveillance even when relieving himself. Nobody in Drapia talked about Ungpam.<br>But against all predictions of heated resistance, Ungpam and his followers showed no sign of action. They gave up or followed orders, as if it was expected. Also, although Ungpam's crime was serious, there would be more than enough of resistance if he was executed immediately, it was uncertain for Kazelhike to punish him more  heavily. As time went by in that way, matters of Ungpam easily became silent despite  the importance of the situation.<br>Then one day, as Quadro returned from his duty, he found a letter on his desk. He always brought the letters and documents by himself, or had others deliver them. In other words, no letter could have got on his desk without his permission. Quadro looked around quickly and read the letter.<br>'Dear Chairman Quadro. The strong Drapia empire that we dreamt together begins as of today. Although the path may take a little longer. I shouldn't be sending you a letter, but it felt too sad not to leave a word to my loyal subject and a friend I want on my side, thus I'm writing a short message. You should criticize me. Shouldn't follow me. Should pursue me. Tell them that, you wish to punish the traitor. And when I return and call you, do stand by my side firmly.'<br>Quadro put the letter in the brazier. When the letter was blackened by the fire, Quadro's adjutant hurried in.<br>"What's all the row."<br>"It's terrible, chairman. Ungpam's soldiers defeated the Drakan knights and escaped with him."<br>"... Summon the Senate. Right now."<br>"Yes, sir."<br>The adjutant didn't see. The faint smile of Quadro. Even if he did, he wouldn't have understood the meaning of it.
Index_1016=S-stop! Descendant of Kaizel! You of all people shouldn't do this!<br>The guardian dragon of Vulcan's altar, Epiaros, cried out urgently, but Quadro approached, nonchalantly. Normally, Epiaros would have exterminated any evildoer who entered in an instant. But he hesitated for a moment to the fact that it was a descendant of Kaizel, and Quadro didn't miss the opportunity to use the power of chaos crystal and captured Epiaros alive.<br>"Descendant of Kaizel, you are not thinking right. You should know that the purpose does not justify all means!"<br>"All this is for Drapia and Drakans to rule the world once again. If you're the dragon like our ancestors... You should dream of such world as well. You must"<br>The power in the chaos crystal resonated with Quadro and was boosted further. As Quadro fell further into darkness, blinded by the yearning for domination and conquering, it seemed the chaos crystal was giving more powers to Quadro. Epiaros resisted with all of his powers but it was not enough. Quadro himself was one of the top magicians of Drakans, and what he was holding was the chaos crystal, which held so much evil that it was named the fragment of the body of demon god Sekneum. Epiaros somehow endured his body and soul being devoured by the terrible magic and spoke out of regret.<br>"You are on the wrong path. I feel the blood and resentment of a great many beings! Do you think a kingdom built on such will last long!"<br>Epiaros let out a cry close to screaming and looked into his eyes. It was maddened faith in Quadro's eyes, and Epiaros felt a familiar fear from that shape. I felt this before. Where. Whom. The deja-vu was clear even through the pain that was brought on by evil spirit.<br>"The kingdom will be everlasting. All of Myu continent will serve and obey us, Drakans and me. More, I will become a much more high being. No hero, no devil may be able to stand before me. Because the true order and power is right here."<br>Epiaros knew the reason of the deja-vu.<br>Flame dragon Valtheram, the betrayer of all dragons who denied all order and sacrificed himself to the demon god yearning for power.<br>Many dragons flew into the fire to stop Valtheram. Screams and roaring echoed in the sky, and the air was too full of the smell of burning flesh, bones and scales to breath. They fell from the sky like rain, and there were other dragons on the ground writhing in pain.<br>Quadro's eyes looked so much like those of Valtheram's that was seen in that awful scene by chance. Cold eyes that held no hesitation nor pity, even though it was building the way out of the blood of other beings. Eyes that hated order and pursued chaos. Eyes that yearned for a desire that could never be filled, its depth unfathomable.<br>"Ka, Kaizel's descendant... You... Garrgg!!"<br>Roar of Epiaros broke loose. All kinds of negative feelings filled it. The magic aura that leaked out of chaos crystal coated the body of Epiaros in red, as if it was the blood that ran in veins. What was in that place now wasn't the guardian dragon of Vulcan's altar, but a huge, berserk monster who lost his good nature and was stained with evil powers.<br>Looking at Epiaros who was now moving to destroy what he guarded for aeons, Quadro obtained the chaos crystal and disappeared, with one last comment in a low voice.<br>"You, the great guardian dragon that guarded Vulcan's altar. Be proud of your sacrifice, as it shall become the foundation of a strong Drakans as well.
