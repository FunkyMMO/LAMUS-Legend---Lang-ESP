[MemoryImprint_ScenarioContents]
MemImp_ScenarioContents_11_1=I've been to many places in my life, but the most brutal was definitely the Restricted Area. There's no doubt that those terribly disfigured monsters used to be human beings. Dragging their morbidly strange bodies fused with plant matter, these creatures are only driven by their instinct to kill and devour. I don't know what happened here, but I'm sure it's something unimaginable and it was caused by humans. May god, any god, have mercy on these poor souls.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_11_2=For an explorer, getting on an airship to find Pandemonium would be the ultimate thrill. However, there's always danger when embarking on adventures like that. All those high hopes for discovering the unknown world quickly turn to terror and fear when the airship and its engine are utterly destroyed by demons shortly after takeoff. Come to think of it, it was a miracle that anyone made it back alive.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_11_3=I've been lucky enough to visit a place called Realm of Perseverance: Proof, though only for a little bit, thanks to a friend of mine who was once a Dracans Knight. It's home to a giant evil dragon that threatened the Dracans, and it reeks of death. Even from a distance, the dragon's furious roar made us freeze in fear. At that moment, my gut told me, "Something's not right here," and I found myself running for the exit.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_11_4=I don't think I'll ever forget the shock of entering this place for the first time. For starters, I just couldn't understand how such a giant structure stayed afloat in the sea. And what about everything inside? I had never seen such metal and material, all woven colorfully together. And it's all maintained by some mystical energy. The future had always been right there in that ark, having stood dormant for an eternity.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_12_1=Miren... was my teacher. Everything I know, I learned from her. She was a friend and faithful servant of Queen Cara. She possessed such a relentless, unyielding spirit... I was always proud to say that "She is my teacher." I can't believe someone so magnificent like her met such... a bleak end. I really feel depressed when I think about that. I hope... Sapientia forgives her sins and embraces her.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_12_2=If you're an Ashas, you shall, of course, honor your ancestors. Even if you're not a member of the Ashas, you are hereby commanded to obey our laws. This is the final resting place of our great ancestors. Though they were but nomads who had left their vanished homeland, the foundation they built allowed for us to stand firmly on our feet. It is thus the duty of all who visit this Pilgrim's Rest to convey their utmost respect for our ancestors' sacrifice and noble efforts.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_12_3=The Maze of Scales... is extremely difficult to escape from, once you're in there. The loot plundered by the Nagas is taken there. The ground is fractured into countless pieces, so it messes with your sense of space when you wander in there. Many comrades were lost forever after they attempted to bring retribution to the Nagas. So, I would urge you to refrain from going there at all. If you do go, please exercise due caution.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_12_4=The dark aura is consuming me bit by bit, from all directions. The pain makes it difficult to even tell if it is day or night. If I fall, the minds of all my fellow Ashas will be corrupted. My people, that our ancestors protected, will never meet their ends here. I will seal myself this day and trap the demonic energy within me. And I shall defeat it. No matter what. My last hope is that I may continue this record with my own handwriting again.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_13_1=It was burning fear itself. The giant eye in the center of its body could see everywhere without a single blind spot, thanks to the dozens of other floating eyes that were seeking targets to set aflame. The red hot, freakish tentacles spewed off so much heat that it was impossible to go near them. There was no doubt... Streams of lava must be flowing inside this monster. Burning, pulsing lava.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_13_2=The azure, frozen wings are the symbol of the queen. The giant lance in her right hand shall mercilessly cut down her enemies. The lamp in her left hand collects frozen souls. It's a beacon that attracts the dead. What could be the reason for hiding one's own soul within the crystal beneath the icecap? Beauty is but a shell. It would be impossible to defy the cold tyranny of the queen who despises even a glimmer of warmth.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_13_3=Hahaha! This is delightful. It gives me such pleasure to see that pink-headed woman lose her mind. Thanks to my research, I knew this would happen when she hoarded all her gold, trying to build a safe in the Rift to evade taxes. And you know what's crazier? She wanted to leave it to the goblins! It's like having the fox guard the hen house. Absolutely out of her mind, I tell you. But it's bothering me that the goblins are about to start wreaking havoc...
MemImp_ScenarioContents_13_4=It's truly amazing. Prolonged exposure to the Rift energy can cause mutation. For example, one might grow a horn or have their skin turn into a different material. Sometimes, the body remains intact, but the person might lose their mind. The more I think about him... I can't fully comprehend what happened to him. How can someone become like that? It's as if a bunch of boxes were haphazardly stuck together. I can't even fathom how some of them might have looked before they mutated.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_14_1=Wallkreiger is the descendant of Kaizel, the Great Dragon King. His mighty roar shakes the world.<br>And yet, he is gracious. Remember that everything we have comes from his flesh and bones.<br>No one shall be able to stop the rage of the Dragon King, whose stature is as the snowy mountains and whose power is like the avalanche.<br>The Dragon King Kaizel and Wallkreiger warriors shall reign forever. Forever and ever.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_14_2=As a matter of fact... The Dragon's Haven was extremely scary. I realized the moment I stepped in there... I am the prey here. I couldn't get myself to take one step further. Then, I met a contract knight... And when I saw the giant heart he carried out, chills ran down my spine. I couldn't even imagine how huge that dragon would be if its heart was already that big. Now that I think of it, listening to my gut saved my life back then.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_14_3=We discovered some unknown organ while investigating the remains and samples of the raging test subject. The energy emitted from that organ is very similar to the telepathic power we Ashas use. We also discovered that the biological magic of the raging test subject was nearly identical to our unique magic power. This leads us to speculate that living Ashas may have served as the basis for the raging test subject... (abridged)
MemImp_ScenarioContents_14_4=It is my great honor to hear your final request. You are my mother and my father, my husband and my wife, my daughter and my son. You are my everything. As I know that you are present in every place, I will not and cannot send you away. I only desire one thing, and one thing alone. I pray you will stay by my side for eternity.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_15_1=...The biggest reason why we were able to win the Three-year War was that grand victory at the Siege of Noria. At the time, the Heraus Coalition had to choose between Karolsandria and Noria. General Cerberus, the commander of the coalition, boldly chose Noria. This ultimately turned out to be the right decision. Unable to withstand the fierce attack of the coalition and the incredible martial prowess of General Cerberus, the demons began to lose ground.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_15_2=On a side note, there are many stories about General Cerberus. He had demonstrated such prowess in battle, it's easy to believe his deeds might have been the work of the gods or angels. The way the general covered the earth with storms, and froze and burnt his enemies was clearly superhuman. That is why many have come to refer to him as the reincarnation of a god or an angel. Some even say that he is a high-ranking demon who betrayed Sekneum.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_15_3=Although I have never doubted my own skills and destiny, I can't help but think that this necklace has not been granted to me. The power within this necklace could almost be compared to that of a god. What staggering price will I have to pay to wield such power? However, my life would be a small sacrifice to pay if it means Noria can be saved... I will thus put my fear aside for now.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_15_4=Akneria completely annihilated the Supanas, a race of perfect beings that she created herself. The reason for their decimation was that the Supanas defied the goddess by creating a Talisman. Although capital punishment is not out of the ordinary for treason, it does seem rather odd that the goddess did not dispose of the Talisman. As humble creatures, we dare not question the will of the creator... yet I can't help but wonder if the Supanas and the birth of the Talisman were all part of her grand scheme...
MemImp_ScenarioContents_16_1=We can't sit back and let them have all the fun, can we? Just think of the Tower of Dawn as the prelude to our counterattack!"<br>Kundun, the ruler of the Mediah Kingdom, said this nonchalantly as he gazed at the majestic tower under construction. This was the moment when the efforts of the Silverfel Knights and the Archmage Kundun came to fruition.<br>The giant Tower of Dawn is unquestionably the very pinnacle of magic and all its secrets.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_16_2=The Tower of Dawn is the crowning achievement of all the research conducted by the Silverfel Knights and Kundun. As the archive for the information on all sorts of demonic and evil threats to MU continent, the tower also serves as the optimal training center to prepare against the threat of Pandemonium.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_16_3=Kundun and the Silverfel Knights are striving to incorporate even more cutting-edge substances into the Tower of Dawn. Based on their research, they have reinforced monsters' abilities, even giving life to creatures that, until now, were only found in ancient literature. Suffice to say, the internal structure of the tower has been set up to resemble Pandemonium itself. The Tower of Dawn was built thanks to the prescience of Kundun. It will serve as an outstanding training center to produce warriors who will one day have to take the fight to the Pandemonium.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_16_4=Another interesting topic being researched at the Tower of Dawn is the "Manatech Driver," an astounding technology based on a Talisman. Despite criticism and concerns that exploiting a Talisman may incur the wrath of the goddess, as the Supanas did, Kundun and his colleague Etramu forged ahead with the research, though their work was restricted to the Tower of Dawn. They were convinced the completion of this research would immensely aid in the battle against Pandemonium.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_17_1=I can still vividly remember the moment when I first set foot in that place. Filled with strange energy, it was clear that there was something haunting about the battlefield. The being slowly approaching through the fog was clearly hostile. I knew only one would remain standing after this fierce battle. Everyone else was my enemy. Would I be able to survive this chaotic battlefield where I only have myself to rely on?
MemImp_ScenarioContents_17_2=Frankly, that place didn't really leave the best impression on me. Having to fight just for the sake of winning, without even knowing who the opponent is... But as I got used to it, I began to feel an eerie sense of attraction to that place. The relentless tension, knowing everyone's against you, could only be found there. And the satisfaction of being the one and only winner was incomparable. Eventually, I found myself heading back there again.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_17_3=The fact that there is room for only one winner also means that everyone else is doomed to fail. Come to think of it, I've heard that in another battlefield, only the victor may eat chicken... It sounds like a funny way to celebrate victory, but to each their own, I suppose. Anyway, some days things go well, and others not so much. Currently, it's closer to the latter.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_17_4=Checking my progress after each frenzied battle is both an exciting and necessary step. The results show me where my current standing is. Of course, novice entrants will find themselves lingering in the lower rankings, but the summit won't seem so far once you start making your way up. And so, in anticipation of that day, we put ourselves through the trials again today.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_18_1=...And that's how the great evil dragon, Death Roar, succumbed to swords, arrows, magic, and maces of great warriors. The Dracans cheered jubilantly, of course. They were finally free from the agent of darkness and death that could have struck them at any time. It was such a relief to everyone, you see. The celebrations continued for three days and three nights without end. The songs that praised the warriors' achievement rang throughout Dracansor.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_18_2=We've confirmed complete silence and no activity from the raging test subject. Although it may return to life through some means unknown to us, this great threat has been neutralized for now. The areas and lifeforms contaminated by the raging test subject's spores will likely recover gradually as well. However, there is still the danger of a new threat. As such, access by civilians and non-combatants may still need to be restricted.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_18_3=We made great strides in paving our path to Pandemonium, thanks to you. At this rate, I'm confident that we may truly be able to pioneer the way to Pandemonium. Of course, it won't be easy, I'm sure. Those demons won't just sit back and watch, either. I mean, who would ignore a giant airship, poking around everywhere to find your base camp? However, we will continue to forge on ahead... For the sake of the peace and prosperity of our world.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_18_4=Well done. This is yet another great deed to add to your achievements so far. Honestly, my expectations weren't even this high at first. However, you've managed to exceed them every time. So, I'll let you in on a secret. What lies ahead of you is not exactly smooth sailing. In fact, your destiny is complicated... Very complicated, indeed. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. So, keep your chin up and continue forging ahead. That's all that I can ask of you. Okay?
MemImp_ScenarioContents_21_1=Now I'm just a sick, old man, waiting only for the final silence, with no strength to step outside at all. I just want to tell about anything until I become totally silenced.<br>Will you listen to my story? I can only tell of it in writing, as no one would visit this lonely old man.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_21_2=Although I am old now, I was just like other youths when I was young. I was crazy for adventure, and I neglected everything for stimulation of my young soul.<br>What I'm about to tell, is about my last adventure.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_21_3=In those days, I was wondering about what was a 'true fear'. Is it strange? Fear sometimes spout out the blood of simulation which is the desire for survival by stabbing deeply into the dried emotion. To feel this fear to the limit, I once stood against the dragon of death in the forbidden area of Drakans.<br>Even then, there was an insatiable thirst.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_21_4=Then, how to fill the insatiable thirst? That kind of thing cannot be filled at once. It slowly... but constantly visits me, ever stronger. Do you not understand? Then it is a long way from visiting you.<br><br><font size='15' color='#FDC243'>Now it is time to end my last adventure.</font>
MemImp_ScenarioContents_22_1=Hi? I'm sorry to ask when we've just met, but won't you listen to my song? Really, really! It's a good song... huh? Not interested? Oh, come one, just once! Huh?
MemImp_ScenarioContents_22_2=I'm gonna? You're okay? Just for 1 minute, okay?<br><br>Were you happy~ were you in love~ now I send you to where there are no pain, no agony~ I will follow with a happy smile, one day when I shall~ so don't be sad if I cry, if I cry just a little~
MemImp_ScenarioContents_22_3=How was it? Wasn't it good? I heard that accidentally when I was picking herb in the front yard. Actually, grownups told me not to go there because it was dangerous, but I had to because that's the only place I could find the herb for my sick sister... It's by the shore where there are abandoned boat and net, do you know?
MemImp_ScenarioContents_22_4=You should pay a visit there! You can hear an angelic song there sometimes, you know? Grownups caught me when I was on my way back... So it will be hard for me to go there for a while, but you should go there and listen if you can.<br><br><font size='15' color='#FDC243'>Oh~ I'm sure it was an angel who was singing...</font>
MemImp_ScenarioContents_23_1=This lighthouse is now too old! It was made a long time ago so it's low, no ships visit here, and it leaks in rain!<br>Only thing left is the mysterious pattern shining from the floor of the lighthouse... which has nothing to do with the function of it...
MemImp_ScenarioContents_23_2=Wait, couldn't we add this light from the floor to strengthen the lighthouse light? Then it will shine further, which will enable us to see the ships that are too far to see now.<br>Right?
MemImp_ScenarioContents_23_3=What? What do I mean? See, we're keepers of the lighthouse so we have to guard it, and make the lighthouse better!<br>... This is not a lighthouse? Wait... Who are you, talking to me?
MemImp_ScenarioContents_23_4=You're... a human? Finally... Finally our lighthouse has a visitor! What can I do for you? Won't you help me find measures to strengthen the lighthouse light?<br><br><font size='15' color='#FDC243'>Maybe, the sparkling metal in your hands may help.</font>
MemImp_ScenarioContents_24_1=The baleen of the sky baleen whale is so soft, people say it is like heavenly silk. That's why many people gather to hunt the legendary sky baleen whale. However, no one has ever seen the sky baleen whale. Why?<br><br>Because everyone who saw the whale has died.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_24_2=But a few months ago, someone claimed viewing the sky baleen whale. Everybody called him mad but he actually knew about the characteristics of the whale and greedy people gathered under him.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_24_3=I tried to stop him many times but he never listened and went off on a trip to hunt that sky baleen whale with his followers for one more try. And was their hunt for the sky baleen whale successful? There was no news about that. But, his favorite hat has been found in the middle of the lake. That hat wasn't lost even in their first hunt...
MemImp_ScenarioContents_24_4=Actually, the baleen of the sky baleen whale melted away to nothing in 3 days after it is parted with the whale. It is really useless. Foolish, isn't it? I tried so hard to stop him.<br><br><font size='15' color='#FDC243'>If he listened, I needn't have killed him myself.</font>
MemImp_ScenarioContents_25_1=Quadro chugged the strong drink again and again. The worried chamberlain kept telling him to stop, but Quadro just ordered more drinks. He tried to calm down the pain, but the emptiness couldn't be filled. All he could hope for was an alcohol-induced sleep, but instead, his mind was clearing.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_25_2=Of course, prince Ungpam has done a great wrong. But all was to build a mighty Drakans. It was never for personal reason but no forgiveness, no chance of plea was given to the prince. This fact enraged Quadro. But the most enraging was his own helplessness.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_25_3=The will of Kazelhike was weak. Negotiation. That wasn't the reason he overdid by attracting the Nobles' alliance. To hide behind the throne, less than stepping forward. Quadro's despair led his fate astray. Now, he regarded the mission to make the mighty, matchless Drakans was his and his only.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_25_4=The pure magic force, swaying ominously would have made anyone else to shiver in fear. But Quadro laughed out. Chaos crystal. When he found the way to use the power nestled inside, he saw a new path. To become the guardian of the new Drakans. An eternal empire. Land of lord... no, of god. Yes, I will make a land of god. And I will have every other species kneeling in the presence of that empire.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_26_1=I will guard. A great noise echoed within the void. Everyone looked at the great dragon. The dragon spoke again with kindness in its eyes, Ã¢â¬ÅThe place where the words of sublime Vulcan is given. There is nothing of more value than to guard here. As my promise is made to god, I will protect forever, beyond the laws of life and death, I swear.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_26_2=Then the holy light of heavens shined upon the dragon. Of course, not from the sky. As it was within the room of altar. But the blessing of god knows no such boundaries. Everyone just dropped everything and got down to praise the wonderful scene of the dragon being covered in light.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_26_3=After the light was gone, the dragon looked very different. The scales and wings shining of blue was pure like the cloudless sky. The power coming from the dragon was as fresh as a waterfall in summer. Any illness or pain would be lifted if you were close to that dragon. Of course, it would have been cold as the wind of frozen lands to the dishonest.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_26_4=The dragon flapped its wings and roared. It was a gesture of joy, a cry of delight. How could it be not good when god has looked down upon itself. Ã¢â¬ÅAs Vulcan renamed me, I am Epiaros. I am the guardian dragon of crystal rock altar. I will pardon not a drop of unfaithfulness, so no one with evil purpose shall ever dare to set foot in this sacred place!Ã¢â¬Å¥
MemImp_ScenarioContents_27_1=Order is a limit which regulates all. It is a chain. It's not even funny, that everything is decided in it. Higher, lower, bigger, smaller, heavier, lighter. Why give it up when you can be something better.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_27_2=Only chaos shall make us stronger. You have to be unbound of everything to advance to higher dimensions. Yes, this is evolution. There are nothing I wouldn't do to become a greater being.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_27_3=Finally, I am freed of the creator's chains. Demon god Sekneum. The opponent of Arch-Neria. After I accepted his fragment, I can feel the controllable everlasting power coming from me. I loathe myself for keeping order when I could have such powers.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_27_4=My race calls me a betrayer and that I should be executed. My race... do I have to call those lesser beings with that name. No matter how many moths fly into the flame, they will only turn to ashes. I will show them the true power of flame that burns everything.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_28_1=Sekneum the demon god was looking at an angel that has fallen to devildom. The angel was using his force and power to slay numerous demons and monsters, but Sekneum only smiled viciously at his minions getting killed. No, in fact...<br>"This guy looks pretty entertaining. I'll have to keep feeding him. In just the right size.Ã¢â¬Å¥
MemImp_ScenarioContents_28_2=How dare you challenge Arch-Neria with such puny strength! Sekneum! I know you're watching! Come out! I will destroy you and cleanse the world once again with the light of the creator!"<br>Dead bodies of demons and monsters were scattered all around Quinireal. The numbers and size of them were his exploits and proof of power, and he thought these weakling couldn't defeat him.<br>Yes. Sekneum didn't send someone who could defeat him.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_28_3=You should... this way... yes! Now you look like the fallen one! Cry harder! Suffer more! Pump it out! How dare you resist the being of light!"<br>Quinireal laughed while tearing apart the captured demon. Other demons and monsters watching the terrible sight of blood and flesh couldn't advance for fear.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_28_4=No one would mistake Quinireal as a holy angel anymore. The once brightly shining wings protruded in dark purple hue, and sharp bumps covered his body. The shape which almost looked as if the spine was exposed was more bizarre than the monsters he killed. <br>"My eyes were true as always. Only those with talent falls properly."<br>Sekneum smiled in satisfaction and raised his huge body and wrapped it with sinister magic.<br>"So, should I come and welcome our new 'colleague'.Ã¢â¬Å¥
MemImp_ScenarioContents_29_1=The two demons started crushing and chopping my lower body. Blood, flesh and bits of bone flew everywhere, and I was glad the pain was only mine. It was too bad, but the rushing pain was too large for my brain which was still a human one, so I lost consciousness.<br>Extreme pain woke me up like the morning sunshine of a nice day. As I felt pain and looked down, a skirt made of piles of blades were in place of my legs. Ahh, if someone sat on it lightly, I could rip that person in dozens of shreds. Just thinking of it makes me smile.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_29_2=They are going to change my arms and body at once. A little. No, a lot regrettable. The pain of getting the arm ripped off should be a different joy from the pain of getting the intestines dug up. A very sweet cake and a juicy steak. It's like that, people say they're both delicious but they're different. Still, this time, I managed to keep my head and enjoy the pain to the end. It was good to have my arms crushed and ripped off, but my favorite part was getting the tissue and intestines ripped off when my belly was cut open.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_29_3=My soul was moved to a new magic device, presumably made by them. I anticipated how my original head and neck will be eliminated in it. Tear out my eyes? Pull out my tongue? Maybe crack my jaws? But they simply pulled out my head and neck, then set my body in the magic device. The new body which was optimized to cut, burn, gouge other living things started moving with a creaking sound as the magic power filled in the soul was supplied.<br>I felt sorry. Why did they leave out the last part? Then the two demons laughed and stuck out the head and neck. Oh, was that it! I felt a shudder. If it was my old body, there would have been goosebumps. So then, I hugged the thing which was 'once my head' with my new body.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_29_4=The end of legend of Elzeta, the great wizard of war, says she plunged into devildom on her own to exterminate demons, but that was far from the truth. From the beginning, she earned the power by breaking the taboo of sacrificing other lives, and decided to become a terrible torturing machine that squeeze life on her own accord as she was corrupted with that power. Even enjoying that terrible and horrendous process. I don't know how many times I puked while I worked on the report reading up on the records carved on her machine body found in devildom.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_30_1=We call it 'devildom' for convenience, but devildom is not a single dimension. It is like us calling the accumulated continents on earth as 'Myu continent.' Devildom is an assembly of dimensions which were considered as failure by the creator Arch-Neria himself.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_30_2=Nobody knows the shapes of creatures and their civilizations living in each dimensions. There could be dimension full of monstrosity, and there could be a civilization way more advanced than ours. Who knows. There may exist a really paradise-like beautiful and livable dimension. How could we, as creations, know what was the criteria that the creator deemed as failure.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_30_3=That's why I vaguely thought that the threat of devildom wasn't just the commanders and monsters with powerful magic or strength that we have fought until now. But since it was always those who attacked us, our research and countermeasures were based on such.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_31_1=But now it's different. Kylops red and Kylops blue. The threat that is represented by these two has shown us that the imagination until now has been confirmed as reality. We don't know how many dimensions devildom is consisted of, but now we know there are 'various' kind of threats as well as 'many' threats.
MemImp_ScenarioContents_31_2=Researching the Kylops, at least we found out that the technological civilization of those dimensions surpasses ours. Countless magicians, technicians, and researchers are studying Kylops day and night. Including myself, as well. Haha, the greatest magician of Myu continent, Kundun Memphis cannot miss out. Wouldn't you agree! Haha... laugh, damn you. Ahem... for real...
MemImp_ScenarioContents_31_3=Anyway, we could stop a completely different kind of disaster thanks to you and many others. And the technology we gain from Kylops will become our new shields and weapons, which will prevent the invasion of other devildoms and enable us to fight back. Only thing I hope for is, that there are no threats that we cannot stand against somewhere in devildom.
