Mission1_1=Wait, what is this? A trace of a high-leveled spell, perhaps?
Mission1_2=The Kunikuluses can't have done it. How suspicious!

[Quest_202807]
Mission1_1=The traces stop here. Ahead of here is Death Roar's lair.
Mission1_2=Did they pass there? I'd better check.

StartQuest1=The Demons have resurfaced for the first time in two hundred years...
StartQuest2=Why?
GreetingQuest1=I can't identify this energy...
GreetingQuest2=I should report this to Leo.

[Quest_5002]
StartQuest1=Is she an elf?
GreetingQuest1=I can't destroy it.
GreetingQuest2=Maybe it can't be destroyed by physical force alone.

[Quest_5003]
StartQuest1=I didn't know the pathway that connects Pandemonium to this realm was so powerful.

[Quest_5004]
StartQuest1=Rarbas have entered the tunnel at last. This is my fault.
StartQuest2=I didn't get rid of all the explosives in the Amberial Forest.
CompleteQuest1=Duprian, he's a natural leader.

[Quest_5005]
StartQuest1=He was sealed away after the Three Year War. It's going to be a tough battle.
Mission2_1=What's this? Did it belong to Glasha?

[Quest_5007]
StartQuest1=

[Quest_5008]
StartQuest1=Through Evil Energy, like they did in Enova.
StartQuest2=Bredrice Plains must be in shambles by now.

[Quest_5009]
StartQuest1=If this holy water purges the Dark Reaper, then it proves I'm no member of the Mission.
StartQuest2=This'll be Zakarian's penultimate test. If I pass, I'll be able to remember everything!

[Quest_13]
Mission1_1=Mutants threaten the peace of Dudrin, and yet the Lorencia Kingdom Army wants spider legs.
Mission1_2=The Lorencia Kingdom Army... Are they out of their minds?

[//Quest_14]
Mission1_1=Get yourself together and return to Lorencia...!

[Quest_15]
Mission1_1=Shama's intestines... Can they really be used as medicine?

[Quest_24]
StartQuest1=They've set up explosives above the tunnel connected to Dudrin.
StartQuest2=They're planning to invade Dudrin through the tunnel.

[Quest_33]
StartQuest1=I've gotten myself into a war that has nothing to do with me.

[Quest_16]
StartQuest1=So these people believe in a god named Rugard...
StartQuest2=Why isn't Rugard intervening in this situation already?

[Quest_18]
StartQuest1=The Humans, Dwarves, and Elves comprise the Heraus Coalition.
StartQuest2=I wonder what races are in the opposing Line Alliance.

[Quest_19]
Mission1_1=Evil Energy even affects plants.

[Quest_21]
StartQuest1=Royce... Where the hell is it?

[Quest_23]
StartQuest1=Rarbas... What are they up to?
Mission1_1=What's this? It looks like a component of something.

[Quest_28]
StartQuest1=There are detonators. I can stop the explosion if I hurry.
Mission1_1=Phew, I think I've disarmed them all.

[Quest_32]
StartQuest1=On, no! It's not Dudrin they're after!
Mission1_1=No time to lose â€“ got to alert the Weiss Basin that their mine's in danger.

[Quest_29]
StartQuest1=The mine is Dudrin's main source of income. Without it, the city won't survive.
StartQuest2=Those Pandemonium lowlifes are stronger than I thought.

[Quest_30]
StartQuest1=I can't believe the Dwarves have a degenerate like that as their leader.

[Quest_35]
StartQuest1=He's going to run. I've misjudged him.

[Quest_102]
StartQuest1=Time's short, but I'd better rescue the miners here first.
Mission1_1=They can't hurt the miners anymore.

[Quest_103]
Mission2_1=This should be enough to put out the fire.

[Quest_104]
Mission1_1=Phew, it's finally been put out.

[Quest_105]
StartQuest1=In the meantime, I'll scatter the Keru Legion before it gets close to the center of the basin.
StartQuest2=The enemy has enough soldiers to isolate the Weiss Basin.

[Quest_108]
StartQuest1=Linda... I can't stop worrying about her.
Mission1_1=There's no trace of Linda anywhere.

[Quest_135]
StartQuest1=It's too late. Now we'll just have to ambush them.
Mission1_1=It's too late. They've already finished building their base.

[//Quest_135]
Mission1_2=I'll have to go to the Karmatan Mine and join Duprian.

[Quest_136]
StartQuest1=I can't believe she risked her life to come and see me.

[Quest_137]
StartQuest1=I don't know if I can live up to their expectations...

[Quest_111]
StartQuest1=They've reunited with the Pandemonium Army. Are they planning to hit the Karmatan Mine?
Mission1_1=These severed heads will prove that the Goblins participated in the war.

[Quest_112]
StartQuest1=I'll show you what hell looks like, filthy goblins!
Mission1_1=You're homeless now.
Mission2_1=This is the price you pay for siding with Pandemonium again.
Mission3_1=There are too few soldiers. Something seems off.

[Quest_113]
StartQuest1=If I can find their battle plan, I'll know what they're up to.

[//Quest_113]
Mission1_1=They've split it into three pieces.

[Quest_115]
StartQuest1=This is ridiculous...

[Quest_116]
StartQuest1=On, no! If Duprian falls, Dudrin will follow!
Mission1_1=This is for trying to kill Duprian.
Mission1_2=I'm going to the Karmatan Mine. I have to meet Duprian.

[Quest_118]
StartQuest1=They're surrounding the mineâ€”why haven't they attacked yet?
Mission1_1=There's nothing here, except those strange-looking statues.

[Quest_120]
StartQuest1=Royce might know why they want to isolate Karmatan.
Mission1_1=This should have bought Duprian enough time to escape.

[Quest_121]
StartQuest1=Karmatan wasn't their target. Duprian was.
Mission1_1=Civilians...! Those brutes killed any who resisted.
Mission2_1=Bah, I can't find any clues.

[Quest_131]
StartQuest1=Were they sealed in with their master?
Mission1_1=Whoah! Glasha's lieutenants were just as tough as their master.

[Quest_138]
StartQuest1=They're a major player in Dudrin. They should know about the wagons.

[Quest_124]
StartQuest1=This has something to do with the wagons that took those civilians.
StartQuest2=Why did they steal the mine blueprint?
Mission1_1=This must be the blueprint.

[Quest_126]
StartQuest1=Their ultimate target was the Heath Mine! But why?!
Mission1_1=The Mining Association President and I are now even.
Mission1_2=The Eastern Post oversees the Heath Mine.

[Quest_128]
StartQuest1=Why did they drag the miners to the death pit? Better search for some clues.
Mission1_1=What's this? Looks important.

[Quest_201]
StartQuest1=Is this the place? Can regain my memory here?

[Quest_202]
StartQuest1=Duprian... I miss that name.

[Quest_207]
StartQuest1=Those Pandemonium scoundrels haven't given up on invading this realm yet.

[//Quest_207]
StartQuest2=A journey to another continent.

[Quest_203]
StartQuest1=Kundun Mephis, the ruler of the Media Kingdom and one of the great sages...
StartQuest2=Can he help me regain my memory? I hope so...

[Quest_301]
StartQuest1=So they're not just ordinary farmhouses...
StartQuest2=Anyway, I'd better help the workers evacuate.

[Quest_311]
StartQuest1=A large-scale invasion. This is war.
StartQuest2=I need to buy time to let the farm workers evacuate.
Mission1_1=Why're they using stone throwers to attack the plains?

[Quest_312]
StartQuest1=Maybe I should ask someone in the army for help with the evacuation.
Mission1_1=The Evil Energy is mutating the creatures around here.

[Quest_314]
StartQuest1=So, this is Zakarian's first test to help me regain my memory...
StartQuest2=I need to find Pandemonium Army Commander Sezak.
Mission1_1=I've found Sezak's orders.

[Quest_315]
StartQuest1=Dumpain... Mayor of Ohrdor...
StartQuest2=Why did he send the army to the Black Farm?

[Quest_332]
StartQuest1=Sezak is in the vestibule. Vestibule...
StartQuest2=Time to stop this legion of Gnolls that have descended upon the Central Base.

[Quest_318]
StartQuest1=Those damned Kobolds poisoned the grain!
StartQuest2=Got to find the abandoned poison extractors.
Mission1_1=Is this a deadly poison extractor?

[Quest_320]
StartQuest1=Use an extractor to get some of the poison,
StartQuest2=and the Ohrdor Lab can formulate an antidote with it.
Mission1_1=What's this mark for?!

[Quest_333]
CompleteQuest1=Fool me again, and you won't live to see another day.

[Quest_322]
StartQuest1=She doesn't know where the vestibule is.
StartQuest2=I'd better stop the smoke signal first.
Mission1_1=Phew, I stopped the smoke signal before the Kobold Legion could see it.

[Quest_324]
StartQuest1=Like the cursed rat that he is, he's hiding in his lackey's hangout.
StartQuest2=Zakarian's second test is to get rid of him.Wait for me, Sezak.
Mission1_1=Bah, Sezak isn't here anymore.

[//Quest_329]
CompleteQuest1=I finished off the queen. They won't be attacking the farms anytime soon.

[Quest_330]
StartQuest1=If Sezak recognizes me, then I'm a puppet of Pandemonium.
StartQuest2=I won't know until I meet him.
Mission1_1=Losing the leaders of the Gnoll Legion will cripple Sezak.

[Quest_331]
StartQuest1=The vestibuleâ€”it's the cave that generates the Evil Energy!
StartQuest2=Wait for me, Sezak. Please gods, don't let him recognize me...

[Quest_403]
Mission1_1=The corpses have been branded with strange marks.

[Quest_406]
Mission1_1=Is that a civilian campsite?

[Quest_412]
Mission1_1=May this holy water grant you peace...

[Quest_416]
StartQuest1=Lenavis, the last queen of Karol, who was slain unjustly...
StartQuest2=I must stop her resurrection ritual!
Mission1_1=Phew, I stopped the ritual just in time.
Mission1_2=Lunedill will be happy to see me back, for the first time in forever!

[Quest_425]
StartQuest1=Have I awakened the ghosts of the Karol Knights?
StartQuest2=Zakarian played me! Why?!

[Quest_409]
StartQuest1=They're just roaming around. I don't get itâ€”what business could those angry ghosts have there?
StartQuest2=There has to be some reason.
Mission1_1=The ghosts are screaming Madri.
Mission1_2=What does that mean?

[Quest_413]
StartQuest1=The mother of the dead Karol Knights...
StartQuest2=Who the hell is she?

[//Quest_420]
Mission1_1=They killed Samuel's sister, as well as female followers.
Mission1_2=Rest in peace...

[Quest_422]
StartQuest1=I pray the people of Karol and their queen will rest peacefully.

[Quest_426]
StartQuest1=Have I resurrected her?
StartQuest2=I'll send her back from whence she came.

[Quest_427]
StartQuest1=Salormis, the cradle of the Tephakin Principality.
StartQuest2=This'll be the final battle, and by the gods, it will be bloody!

[Quest_502]
StartQuest1=To stop the Tephakin Principality Army from losing...
StartQuest2=I'll light the streetlamps and show the world that Kernel City still stands.
Mission1_1=I pray that all Tephakinese see these lights, even from afar.

[Quest_509]
StartQuest1=Oh no! That titan could crush the entire Duelden Continent!
StartQuest2=I must cut off its black mana supply.
Mission1_1=It was absorbing black mana at a remarkable speed.
Mission1_2=Now I've stopped the titan's resurrection.

[Quest_511]
StartQuest1=Orman, wait for me!
StartQuest2=Maybe Flying Bugs will lead me to the campsite.
Mission1_1=That must be the place. There are fallen Titan's wing shards.

[Quest_512]
Mission1_1=Bah, Orman isn't here anymore.
Mission1_2=What the... is that the entrance? That must be the excavation site.

[Quest_513]
StartQuest1=The Garudas have joined the Pandemonium Army.
StartQuest2=If the entire Alliance has joined the enemy, then we're doomed.
StartQuest3=I'd better check the Garuda messengers.
Mission1_1=I knew I'd find some important documents.
Mission1_2=I'll ask Icarus about them, he should be able to tell me what they're about.

[Quest_518]
StartQuest1=Right now, the Tephakin Principality Army must be fighting the main Garuda forces.
StartQuest2=Better take care of the Gnoll Legion at the rear.
Mission1_1=Now the Garudas have no one to back them up.
Mission1_2=Hm? Who's that?

[Quest_520]
StartQuest1=Orman must be in the Sky Temple, too.
StartQuest2=I must cut a path through the Garuda stragglers and join the Principality Army.
Mission1_1=This is what happens when you get in my way.

[Quest_526]
StartQuest1=Bull! Winning a war isn't worth losing thousands of lives!

[Quest_802]
StartQuest1=The Dios stop, and suddenly everyone turns against you.

[Quest_806]
StartQuest1=If all Kanturians were as peaceful as Estesia,
StartQuest2=they wouldn't have been attacked so viciously, with or without the Dios.
Mission1_1=The place is becoming as warm as Estesia's heart.

[//Quest_808]
Mission1_1=This should be enough food.

[Quest_809]
StartQuest1=I'll give you a slow and painful death.
Mission1_1=You monsters! You killed innocent civilians!

[Quest_810]
StartQuest1=Doctor Marongo has a warm heart.
Mission1_1=It's subtle, but I can tell the temperature is rising.

[Quest_811]
StartQuest1=Cold Stones, shaped to perfection.

[Quest_901]
StartQuest1=Well, knights need to eat too.
Mission1_1=So their hounds have gone feral.

[Quest_903]
StartQuest1=A branch of the Lorencia army has set up shop in the Drapian territory.
StartQuest2=No wonder why the Coalition and the Alliance don't get along.

[Quest_905]
StartQuest1=I'll deal with the heavily armored soldiers first.

[Quest_908]
StartQuest1=They've also been killed by the revenants. Better let Hopkins know.

[Quest_909]
StartQuest1=He's so immature, I feel sorry for those poor Devias Guards who have to put up with him.

[Quest_911]
Mission1_1=Even the repeaters are affected by the revenants.

[//Quest_913]
CompleteQuest1=I heard that there's a path to the Sanguine Highlands nearby...

[Quest_917]
StartQuest1=Phew, the Nobility Alliance sure is a tough nut to crack.
StartQuest2=Their commander is first on my kill list.
Mission1_1=They won't dare mess with Devias for a while.

[Quest_915]
StartQuest1=I don't know if they deserted their barracks to run for their lives, or to their deaths.

[Quest_1003]
StartQuest1=Chaisong would be happy if he knew I helped the Drapians.

[Quest_1006]
StartQuest1=I'd better repair the fences and cull these mutants.

[Quest_1008]
Mission1_1=I'm late... they were all executed.

[Quest_1009]
CompleteQuest1=This must be Blood Ice Peak, the land of death.

[Quest_1010]
StartQuest1=Darn, a scout! I'll get in trouble if I lose them.
StartQuest2=I better kill them before things spiral out of control!

[Quest_1012]
StartQuest1=What the... Oh no! They're absorbing blood from the ground to mutate themselves!

[Quest_1102]
StartQuest1=Those brutes even use animals to help fight their battles!
Mission1_1=They won't threaten the outpost anymore.

[Quest_1103]
StartQuest1=Ah, I forgot to ask their shoe sizes.
Mission1_1=I've got enough boots now.
Mission2_1=This should be enough to feed the army at least once.

[Quest_1107]
StartQuest1=His wife'll be devastated. I can't tell her... no way!

[Quest_1108]
StartQuest1=Mandrake roots. I'm an herbalist now.

[Quest_1109]
StartQuest1=These must be failed test subjects.
StartQuest2=They experimented even on people.

[Quest_1112]
StartQuest1=I hear something over there. Someone's crying.

[Quest_1113]
StartQuest1=Eagles are hard to catch...

[Quest_1104]
StartQuest1=These mutant spiders are worse than those I've seen in Enova.

[Quest_1110]
StartQuest1=Aha, finally we meet. Let's get this over with.

[Quest_1205]
StartQuest1=Where the hell did these ghosts come from? Do they have something to do with that pile of stones?
StartQuest2=My gut tells me I should slay them and destroy that pile.

[//Quest_1205]
MissionDeco2_1_1=It still stands. This is not an ordinary pile of rocks.

[Quest_1208]
StartQuest1=Are these the knights of Pandemonium? They're determined to isolate Dracanem.

[Quest_1211]
StartQuest1=Hmm, what can I find in this frozen land that's edible?

[Quest_1212]
StartQuest1=Frog Beasts... used to eat them a lot when I was in Enova.

[Quest_1303]
StartQuest1=Wow... Even flowers have been mutated.

[Quest_1304]
StartQuest1=What are these beasts? Gremlins' pets? They need to be put down.

[Quest_1308]
StartQuest1=Is he their leader? I'll deal with him before he hurts anyone else.

[//Quest_1314]
CompleteQuest1=This should be enough to slow the proliferation.

[Quest_1401]
Mission1_1=This should be enough.

[Quest_1404]
Mission1_1=Hm? I've found something strange from the animals.
Mission1_2=This looks like a seal. How suspicious!

[//Quest_1406]
Mission1_1=Is that Kunda?
Mission1_2=The corruption has spread... Nothing we can do about it.

[Quest_1406]
Mission2_1=I'd better look around and see what did this to the wild horses.

[Quest_1407]
CompleteQuest1=The energy from these must have affected the animals.
CompleteQuest2=This spell is just like Evil Energy. Where did the Ashases learn this?

[Quest_1409]
Mission1_1=I've found the Brolls' written pledge.
Mission1_2=All right, I'll decorate them nicely.

[Quest_1410]
Mission1_1=With whom did the Brolls make this contract?

[//Quest_1410]
Mission1_2=Mm? Their partner must be here. I'd better go.

[Quest_1414]
Mission1_1=I avenged Balin.
Mission1_2=I'd better tell his sister this.

[Quest_1416]
Mission2_1=Now that the fertilizer is ready, I can just scatter it around the saplings.

[Quest_1420]
Mission1_1=I've found this letter from the Ashases.
Mission1_2=I have no idea what this mark or these letters mean.

[Quest_1422]
Mission1_1=I've caught the commander of the infiltration operation.
Mission1_2=I hope this will discourage the Ashases.

[Quest_1424]
StartQuest1=A device that connects the Ashases' minds...

[Quest_1501]
Mission1_1=This water is definitely contaminated.
Mission1_2=This contamination is not natural.
CompleteQuest1=I've removed most of the contaminants.
CompleteQuest2=Now, I'd better find who contaminated the water.

[Quest_1502]
Mission1_1=It was Ashas' doing. I didn't expect them to stoop so low...

[Quest_1526]
MissionDeco1_1_1=Here they come. Watch out!

[Quest_1511]
MissionDeco1_1_1=Goblins, come on out!
Mission1_1=It wasn't just goblins that were hiding; so were their accomplices.
Mission1_2=It was an impressive feat. That was close.

[Quest_1512]
Mission1_1=I knew the goblins weren't acting on their own.
Mission1_2=I'd better deliver these directives to the farmer.

[Quest_1516]
Mission1_1=I've retrieved the Spirit Exchanger.
Mission1_2=I can activate the Psypher Stones now.

[Quest_1519]
Mission1_1=These holes have something to do with Pandemonium.
Mission1_2=Is the Pandemonium Army trying to infiltrate through the ground? But how?

[Quest_5101]
StartQuest1=So this crystal from Ormanhas created dragons...
StartQuest2=I should go to Kundun and get to the bottom of this.

[Quest_5103]
StartQuest1=I'm about to set foot in Line Alliance territory.
StartQuest2=Why are Heraus and Line so angry at each other?

[Quest_5104]
StartQuest1=Dragons have appeared...
StartQuest2=Neria's Tears also exist here.

[Quest_5105]
StartQuest1=They're closing in on Qwyinan.
Mission1_1=This should do.

[Quest_5106]
StartQuest1=They tried to build a defensive line across the plain.
StartQuest2=The dragons have come this far, which means...
StartQuest3=Their defense line has been penetrated. This doesn't bode well.

[Quest_5107]
StartQuest1=The Line Alliance worships Bulcan, the god of war.
StartQuest2=Could these flags blessed by Bulcan really increase the air temperature?
Mission1_1=The temperature's rising.
Mission1_2=Bulcan's blessing...
Mission1_3=I guess it works just like Rugard's holy water.

[Quest_5108]
StartQuest1=Kundun was right. the Mission has invaded Drapia.
StartQuest2=But what does the Mission intend to do with a frozen land such as this one?

[Quest_5109]
StartQuest1=What's the Dark Mission up to this time?
Mission1_1=I couldn't uncover their true purpose, no matter how much I looked.
Mission2_1=They're too weak. And there are more researchers than soldiers here.

[Quest_5110]
StartQuest1=Now I know what the Mission is up to.
StartQuest2=The Mission is collecting Tears to rain devastation upon all the states of the kingdom!
StartQuest3=And Dracans Knight Master Chaisong was in on this.

[Quest_5111]
StartQuest1=Chaisong must have bribed Chakua.
StartQuest2=He's trying to keep the Dracans Knights tied up here.
Mission1_1=This gold coin is from Drapia, just as I expected.

[Quest_5112]
StartQuest1=Chaisong ran off to the deployment camp. I'd better catch up with him.
StartQuest2=I'll just have to go through the Chakua encampment.
Mission1_1=Their security is tighter than I thought.
Mission2_1=So he was the commander.

[Quest_5113]
StartQuest1=Neria's Tears are in the Closed Waterway.
StartQuest2=Better hurry if I want to catch up with him.

[Quest_5114]
StartQuest1=I'm on his trail now. I must stop him before he gets to Neria's Tears.

[Quest_5117]
StartQuest1=I don't think they're trying to reanimate the dead like they were last time.

[Quest_5118]
StartQuest1=He's risked treason charges to lure the ringleader of the Mission here.
StartQuest2=Chaisong, he's no ordinary man.
StartQuest3=Phew, I pray the ringleader of the Mission took the bait.
Mission1_1=Where could Neria's Tears possibly be?

[Quest_5131]
StartQuest1=They're a highly advanced civilization, like Chaisong said.
StartQuest2=Why did the battle machines stop?
Mission1_1=Without their battle machines, they can't even keep wild animals at bay.

[Quest_5132]
StartQuest1=This isn't good. They rely on Dios for everything.

[Quest_5133]
StartQuest1=These repeaters supply Pectra to the entirety of Musai.
Mission1_1=Bah, the Dios aren't working.

[Quest_5134]
StartQuest1=They've been attacking from all sides since the Dios stopped.
StartQuest2=Maybe the chief can tell me more about their situation.
Mission1_1=This should be enough to keep a path open.

[Quest_5135]
StartQuest1=They've oppressed neighboring races with their superior strength.
StartQuest2=Is helping them really the right thing to do?
Mission1_1=They wouldn't dare attack First Town again.

[Quest_5136]
StartQuest1=The Drapia Kingdom wants Kanturu?
StartQuest2=I can't believe Chaisong would do such a thing, but I won't know the truth until I investigate it myself.

[Quest_5137]
StartQuest1=I knew it wasn't Drapia that invaded Kanturu.
StartQuest2=Is Datans trying to steal Pectra while the Dios are out of order?
Mission1_1=This is what you get for setting fire to Southern Town!
Mission2_1=Why did they abduct the Kanturian scientist?

[Quest_5138]
StartQuest1=Oh, I really hope the Dios turn back on this time.
Mission1_1=Bah, the Dios still aren't moving.

[Quest_5139]
StartQuest1=Things just keep getting worse and worse.
StartQuest2=I still haven't found Marongo, the abducted scientist...

[Quest_5140]
StartQuest1=The Kanturians stole this land from the Golems.
StartQuest2=Maybe this is karma.
Mission4_1=These are magnetic bombs, and there are enough here to do away with an entire state.
Mission4_2=They're not trying to stop Dioâ€”they're trying to destroy Western Town!

[//Quest_5140]
MissionDeco4_1_1=I must have touched something I shouldn't.

[Quest_5141]
StartQuest1=Marongoâ€”he stopped the Dios!

[Quest_5142]
StartQuest1=I'll just have to reset the reactor.
StartQuest2=The Dios must be activated, or else Musai will fall!

[//Quest_5142]
Mission1_1=An autonomous Dio is protecting the fusion reactor... This won't be easy...

[Quest_5146]
StartQuest1=What on earth happened while I was gone?

[Quest_5147]
StartQuest1=Datans, I'll never forgive you!

[Quest_5151]
StartQuest1=Does this mean the Lorencia Kingdom's own Devias Knights hired Woongpam?
StartQuest2=I've got only five days to stop Drapia from collapsing.

[Quest_5152]
StartQuest1=A Coalition army, in Line Alliance territory...
StartQuest2=It's amazing a war hasn't broken out yet.
Mission1_1=Is Devias really in league with Woongpam?

[Quest_5153]
StartQuest1=I don't think Devias Knight Master Muren is lying to me.
Mission1_1=Bah, these officers don't know anything useful.
Mission2_1=All this information is useless. Maybe the Nobility Alliance has nothing to do with it.

[Quest_5154]
StartQuest1=Who could possibly wipe out Devias scouts? Well, better go find out.
Mission1_1=They've even mobilized cannons. They're determined to keep the Devias members here.

[Quest_5156]
StartQuest1=The revenants killed everyone!
StartQuest2=I've got to stop them before they begin appearing everywhere.
StartQuest3=The Mission's doing just what they did in Karolsandria!

[Quest_5157]
StartQuest1=I must stop the revenants' ritual!
Mission1_1=The ritual's almost over.
Mission1_2=I don't know if I stopped their resurrection or not.

[Quest_5158]
StartQuest1=I'd better go back and tell Muren about the revenants
StartQuest2=and that their emperor might be among them.

[Quest_5159]
StartQuest1=When the revenants come out of the royal tomb, it'll be only a matter of time before the entire continent is overrun with them.

[Quest_5160]
StartQuest1=That was reckless. No one could've survived that.
StartQuest2=That goddamned Mission!
Mission1_1=I think I've got enough drinking water now.

[Quest_5161]
StartQuest1=Phew, First it was Queen Lenavis, and now it's Emperor Zelos.
StartQuest2=I must appease the revenants before they come out of the tomb.
Mission1_1=Phew, he was tougher than Queen Lenavis.

[Quest_5162]
Mission1_1=It was a diversion, to protect whatever they're scheming at in Sanguine Highlands.

[//Quest_5162]
Mission1_2=What are they up to?

[Quest_5163]
StartQuest1=What if the Dark Mission has reached this far? Oh, no...
Mission1_1=They've been resurrected by black magic.
Mission1_2=I knew the Mission was behind this!
Mission3_1=Where the hell are the scouts?
Mission3_2=Should I check there?

[Quest_5171]
StartQuest1=These bears seem to be frozen, yet they still move.

[Quest_5172]
StartQuest1=Those people... They look familiar.

[Quest_5173]
StartQuest1=Two hundred years ago, a bloody war was fought between Pandemonium and this realm,
StartQuest2=and the battlefield is still soaked in blood.
Mission1_1=I can't fix this pentacle. I don't know what to do at the moment.

[Quest_5174]
StartQuest1=By the way, what's the Tephakin Army doing here?
StartQuest2=In the northeast... Perhaps I can talk to them. I'd better go find out.

[Quest_5175]
StartQuest1=The private army of Khali, heir of the Principality...
StartQuest2=What on earth are they planning here?
Mission1_1=The Dark Mission! Why are they here, at this Tephakin Army encampment?

[Quest_5177]
StartQuest1=What a fool! He was so focused on revenge, he couldn't see that the Nobility Alliance was using him!
StartQuest2=It was the Nobility Alliance who hired Woongpam to steal Pectra!
StartQuest3=Phew, better hurry. The Blood Mutants are attacking.
Mission1_1=Damn it, they were killed by those Blood Mutants.
Mission2_1=They killed an entire unit of scouts.

[Quest_5178]
StartQuest1=They're in denial. The remaining two places can't be safe either.
Mission1_1=Damn! They also got the observer unit. Is he the only survivor?

[Quest_5179]
StartQuest1=I'd better send carrier pigeons to the Tephakin Principality for help.
StartQuest2=I pray the signal corps is safe...
Mission1_1=Damn it, even the signal corps was wiped out. Cursed Nobility Alliance!
Mission3_1=They even killed the carrier pigeons... Now the Tephakin Principality is completely cut off from the rest of the world.

[Quest_5180]
StartQuest1=I didn't see this coming. Great, now I've wasted precious time running around Wallkreiger.
StartQuest2=They must be busy playing with Pectra by now.
Mission1_1=A path is secured. Better get to the supply camp as soon as possible.

[Quest_5181]
StartQuest1=It was the army of Marquis Heston, of the Nobility Alliance.
StartQuest2=He has the Pectra wand.
Mission1_1=He doesn't have the Pectra wand!
Mission1_2=Wh-what is this place?

[Quest_5182]
Mission1_1=The Nobility Alliance has handed the Crystal Cave over to Pandemonium. Why?
Mission1_2=Better ask Chaisong.

[Quest_5191]
StartQuest1=I'll have to go to the Mining Gorge where the Crystal Cave is.
StartQuest2=I only have three days left until the deadline the Kanturians gave me.
Mission2_1=No time to waste, I have to get to the Devias encampment.
Mission2_2=Muren might know why the Nobility Alliance handed the Crystal Cave over to Pandemonium.

[Quest_5192]
StartQuest1=The Nobility Alliance is just assisting the Pandemonium Army.

[Quest_5193]
StartQuest1=I couldn't find any clues. It's time to talk to their intelligence officers.
Mission1_1=I've found something! It's a letter.

[Quest_5194]
StartQuest1=What're they trying to do with these captured test subjects?
Mission1_1=Are these abominations test subjects?
Mission2_1=The test subjects are being transported somewhere. Not if I can help it!

[Quest_5195]
Mission1_1=They were heading northeast, to the Mining Association I guess.

[Quest_5196]
StartQuest1=I need to stop them. I know, I'll get rid of their horses and carriages.
Mission2_1=Killing innocent horses... What have I done?

[Quest_5197]
StartQuest1=They've sent a request to the Nobility Alliance for backup.
CompleteQuest1=Now, what should I do with you?

[Quest_5198]
StartQuest1=Woongpam, the leader of the Datanses, has come to the Crystal Cave.

[Quest_5199]
StartQuest1=I'll know if I investigate their weapons.
Mission1_1=All these weapons were made in Pandemonium. They're in league with each other.

[Quest_5200]
StartQuest1=Well, good for you and whatever crazy schemes you've got going on.
StartQuest2=OK, I need to get more information from the undercover Dracans Knight at Datans camp.
Mission1_1=Where the hell is the undercover Dracans Knight?

[Quest_5201]
StartQuest1=Pandemonium's brigade commander is guarding the place himself.
StartQuest2=They're using the test subjects for something terrible.
Mission1_1=I took care of him. Now, where's the lab?

[//Quest_5207]
Mission1_1=Woongpam... He injected Pectra into the Tarsk and mutated it!

[Quest_5210]
StartQuest1=I knowâ€”I'll use the Inter-Area Portal Stone, that'll get me to the Devias outpost in the Mining Gorge.
StartQuest2=The Sanctum of the Elders isn't far from there.

[Quest_5211]
StartQuest1=Thrashers! Better get rid of them before they become a nuisance.
Mission1_1=Better hurry. I've got only two days until the deadline the Kanturians gave me.

[Quest_5212]
StartQuest1=He wants to warn the Elders of the Pandemonium Army's scheme to inject its soldiers with Pectra.
StartQuest2=I must fight my way through the Chakuas and meet Chaisong.
Mission1_1=Cowards! How dare you hurt innocent civilians!

[Quest_5213]
StartQuest1=I'd better find the nomads before they get hurt.

[Quest_5214]
StartQuest1=The nomads aren't here.
StartQuest2=No, I can't allow the Chakuas' stronghold to stay standing.
Mission1_1=The nomads, where are they?

[Quest_5215]
StartQuest1=They've bribed the Chakuas, just to mess with Chaisong.
StartQuest2=Better rescue the abducted nomads first.

[Quest_5216]
StartQuest1=That damned Chakua tricked me! He lured me into a camp full of his own kind!
StartQuest2=Hahaha, you fools. I could slay you all without breaking a sweat.

[Quest_5217]
StartQuest1=Hm? Is that a lodge up on that hill?

[Quest_5218]
StartQuest1=They've been kept here. I'm glad they're all alive.
Mission1_1=Oh, their bodies must be numb after being tied up for so long.

[Quest_5219]
StartQuest1=Where the Silver Sparrowhawk Camp is? OK, let's go save them!

[Quest_5220]
StartQuest1=The Keru Legion emerged from the Evil Energy... I wasn't expecting that! Its members are more skilled than I thought.
StartQuest2=But who? ...The Silver Sparrowhawks! I can't believe they fooled me!

[Quest_5221]
StartQuest1=I've wasted too much time already. Time to get moving to Dracanem.
StartQuest2=I must get to Chaisong before the Pandemonium Army gets its Pectra boost.
Mission1_1=Good, I've neutralized the Kerus' defense line. Soon Dracanem will be in sight.
Mission1_2=They must be their commanders.

[Quest_5222]
StartQuest1=Hmm, I don't know if I can persuade the Elders...

[Quest_5231]
Mission1_1=Ugh, remains of Dracanses everywhere!

[Quest_5223]
StartQuest1=Those scoundrels, they've invaded Dracanem to stop the Coalition and the Alliance from working together.
Mission3_1=This should be enough to convince the Elders.

[Quest_5224]
StartQuest1=Finally the Coalition and the Alliance can work together.
StartQuest2=Better let Muren know.
Mission1_1=Is that the Devias encampment?
Mission1_2=Muren will jump for joy when he finds out the joint operation has been approved.

[Quest_5225]
StartQuest1=It'll take too long for the two armies to join each other.
StartQuest2=I've got to infiltrate the prison camp before the amplifier is completed.

[Quest_5226]
StartQuest1=More wardens have escaped.
Mission2_1=No... they're all dead. The enemy's 17th Special Forces Group did this!

[Quest_5227]
StartQuest1=Bah, I've wasted too much time already.
StartQuest2=If the prisoners are injected with Pectra, it'll be the end of Drapia.
StartQuest3=I must destroy the amplifier before that happens.

[Quest_5228]
StartQuest1=Damn! The leader of the prisoners is blocking the way to the amplifier.

[Quest_5233]
Mission1_1=That's what happens to those who covet Pectra.
Mission1_2=Finally I've got the Pectra wand back!

[Quest_5235]
StartQuest1=Are those Dracans Warriors?

[//Quest_5236]
StartQuest1=I have to find a Pectra amplifier to mutate prisoners.

[Quest_5240]
StartQuest1=Damn it, they didn't steal just one wandâ€”they stole two!
StartQuest2=The Prison Camp was just a decoy!
Mission1_1=Ah, this must be the War Shelter.

[Quest_5241]
StartQuest1=First, I need to assess the severity of the Pandemonic changes in this area.
Mission1_1=Oh no! The plants... everything on the land is changing rapidly.
Mission2_1=This is not good, things are changing too quickly. Just a matter of time before this spreads across the entire continent.
Mission3_1=Those thugs, what are they trying to do with the other wand?

[Quest_5242]
StartQuest1=I'd better go to the Union Headquarters.
StartQuest2=Both Chaisong and Muren should be there.

[Quest_5243]
StartQuest1=They've grown so big, they look like they're going to explode soon!

[Quest_5244]
StartQuest1=They're using the other wand to build Evil Energy tunnels.

[Quest_5245]
StartQuest1=If I follow the Pandemonic energy, it'll lead me to Evil Energy tunnels.
StartQuest2=Where can I find scorpion oil?
Mission1_1=This should be enough.

[//Quest_5246]
StartQuest1=I'm machine illiterate...

[Quest_5246]
Mission1_1=Yes! It's working!

[Quest_5247]
StartQuest1=An Evil Energy tunnel is being built in one of the two places.
StartQuest2=I'll rescue the Kanturian's daughter first.
Mission1_1=Bah, those goddamn Gremlins!

[Quest_5248]
StartQuest1=My condolences, Kanturian hermit. I'll avenge her death.

[Quest_5249]
StartQuest1=I got fooled again. I'll have to find their commander on my own.
Mission1_1=The woman you killed was the daughter of Wake, a Kanturian.
Mission1_2=Time to go. Muren and Chaisong must be waiting impatiently...

[Quest_5250]
StartQuest1=I've no choice. I can't let the Tears fall into the hands of those Pandemonium scoundrels.

[Quest_5251]
StartQuest1=An adopted Human daughter... This will require some... adjustment.
Mission1_1=Damn it! They beat me to it.

[Quest_5252]
Mission1_1=Be careful... Oh, that's a good boy!
Mission2_1=I avenged his mother's death, but the rage still lingers on.
Mission2_2=I grow tired of this war.

[Quest_5253]
StartQuest1=Soon the ward of Neria's Tears will perish.
StartQuest2=I have to get Neria's Tears before the Pandemonium Army.

[Quest_5255]
Mission1_1=What... The wounded...

[Quest_5256]
StartQuest1=I really need to meet up with the Union,
StartQuest2=but I just can't ignore these people.

[Quest_5257]
StartQuest1=OK, better hurry and catch up with the Union.
StartQuest2=The Evil Energy tunnel will be completed soon.

[Quest_5258]
StartQuest1=Oh, what's that gigantic thing?

[Quest_5259]
StartQuest1=It's a massive cannon, and it's aimed north, at the Union.
Mission1_1=I hope I destroyed that massive cannon in time, before it damaged the Union.

[Quest_5260]
Mission1_1=Those men over there. Are they the Dracans Knights?

[Quest_5261]
StartQuest1=So this is what Kelbra wanted Neria's Tears for, right from the beginning.
StartQuest2=I have to stop the Ice Dragon's resurrection, or it'll be the end of the Union.
Mission1_1=Wow, I've never seen so many dragons in one place. The power of Neria's Tears is unfathomable.
MissionDeco2_1_1=I stopped the Ice Dragon from resurrecting, but its spirit got through! It flew to the southwest.
MissionDeco2_1_2=Looks like I've got some loose ends to tie up.

[Quest_5270]
StartQuest1=If the Silverfel Knights join us, there's still hope!

[Quest_5262]
StartQuest1=Kundun... Have I misjudged him?
Mission1_1=I don't get it, why would Kundun want these skulls?

[Quest_5271]
StartQuest1=Bah, the Silverfel Knights aren't coming. I'll have to meet up with the Union by myself.
StartQuest2=I hope the damage isn't too severe...

[Quest_5263]
StartQuest1=We don't have enough soldiers left. We've lost so many...

[//Quest_5264]
Mission1_1=What's that? Strange Slaughterer? Seriously?

[Quest_5264]
Mission1_1=Let's get going. Four of us should be enough.

[Quest_5266]
StartQuest1=He's the commander of the Pandemonium Army in Litenberg.
StartQuest2=He must be guarding the Evil Energy tunnel.
CompleteQuest1=Now, all that's left is to destroy the Evil Energy tunnel.

[Quest_601]
StartQuest1=Even the members of city garrisons are being drafted.
StartQuest2=The situation must be critical.

[Quest_602]
StartQuest1=The Warriors must be the name of its regular army.
Mission1_1=They wouldn't dare attack Qwyinan again, at least for a while.

[Quest_603]
StartQuest1=The Mediahns...

[Quest_604]
StartQuest1=They're rather bold.

[Quest_605]
StartQuest1=Two opposing states on one continent...
StartQuest2=I'm amazed both still stand.

[Quest_606]
StartQuest1=This base won't last long.
Mission1_1=There are so many, I've lost count.
Mission2_1=The Mission has occupied the north.

[Quest_607]
StartQuest1=Dragons showed up when the fire in the brazier was extinguished...
StartQuest2=This doesn't add up. I thought dragons were conceived from Neria's Tears.

[Quest_608]
StartQuest1=Everywhere I go, there are people brainwashed by the Mission.
Mission1_1=They left nothing but their scales behind.
Mission1_2=They were fools, yes, but I do pity them.

[Quest_609]
StartQuest1=Why haven't they left yet?
Mission1_1=I didn't properly secure my retreat route, and that's on me.

[Quest_610]
StartQuest1=A Lorencian shepherd in Drapia...
StartQuest2=Sheesh! The stars must have been misaligned on the day he was born!

[Quest_611]
StartQuest1=Priest Mannu is a good man.
Mission1_1=They won't dare show up near the breeding camp again.

[Quest_612]
StartQuest1=Please don't die...

[Quest_613]
StartQuest1=It seems they only respond to force.
Mission1_1=Eliminated an advance party of Chakuas.
Mission2_1=Eliminated the second advance party of Chakuas.

[Quest_614]
StartQuest1=They're attacking from both the north and the south.
Mission1_1=These are pretty heavy.

[Quest_615]
StartQuest1=It's time to burn things down.
Mission1_1=The Chakuas will have to starve from now on.

[Quest_616]
StartQuest1=I feel like I've been set up.
Mission1_1=This doesn't look tempting.
Mission2_1=I've got enough meat from the small ones.

[Quest_617]
StartQuest1=I can't believe we've crossed paths again.

[Quest_618]
StartQuest1=I've got to stop them before more Evil Energy tunnels open.
Mission1_1=They're weak, for mutants.

[Quest_619]
StartQuest1=The Mission must be behind this.
Mission1_1=I knew the Mission was behind this, but why?

[Quest_620]
StartQuest1=I have to do this, for my loved ones.
Mission1_1=Does this strange substance really have medicinal benefits?

[Quest_621]
StartQuest1=They can smell money from miles away.
Mission1_1=What good does revenge do now?
Mission1_2=
Mission2_1=
Mission3_1=
Mission4_1=Rest in peace, child.
Mission4_2=

[Quest_8102]
Mission1_1=He's not here, either. Mukler, you'd better wish I can't find you.

[Quest_208]
MissionDeco1_1_1=Dumpain Kerka is the law and the truth.
MissionDeco2_1_1=Those who plot against Ohrdor will be exiled.

[Quest_209]
MissionDeco1_1_1=This is heavy. How important can it be?

[Quest_210]
MissionDeco1_1_1=My storage service is so popular, everyone on the continent wants it!
MissionDeco2_1_1=You came at the right time. I've got some potions I need to deliver to the Enova Continent.
MissionDeco3_1_1=It's time my great armor sees the world.

[Quest_211]
MissionDeco1_1_1=Where on earth is Kundun?
MissionDeco2_1_1=Is there any lucrative job I can take on?
MissionDeco3_1_1=Soon Ohrdor will be covered in darkness.

[Quest_222]
MissionDeco1_1_1=Hey, you didn't open this fruit box, did you?
MissionDeco1_2_1=What's in that box? It looks suspicious.

[Quest_325]
MissionDeco1_2_1=We must get rid of the Gnolls!
MissionDeco1_3_1=We're here, and it's all thanks to you, Knight!

[//Quest_424]
MissionDeco1_1_1=I really want to find the treasure.
MissionDeco1_2_1=Thank you for bringing me here safely.
MissionDeco2_1_1=Please cover me while I look for the treasure!
MissionDeco2_1_2=Please protect me from the monsters!

[Quest_528]
MissionDeco1_1_1=Knight, let's go!
MissionDeco1_2_1=I'm here, and it's all thanks to you, Knight!
MissionDeco1_2_2=Thank you! You deserve to be called Tephakin's Light.

[Quest_918]
MissionDeco2_1_1=Knight... Please... take me... ugh... to my... unit...
MissionDeco2_1_2=The Devias Knights should be... able to get them... out of... here... safe... Ugh...
MissionDeco2_2_1=Th-thank you... But I don't think... I... *Cough*
MissionDeco2_3_1=Darn it! I'm late. I'd better tell my brother.

[Quest_1213]
MissionDeco1_1_1=Watch for the freed captives!
MissionDeco1_2_1=Let's keep going!
MissionDeco2_1_1=I'm glad I have such a strong knight like you with me.
MissionDeco2_2_1=Thank you. My late comrades will also thank you from Heaven.

[Quest_1316]
MissionDeco1_1_1=Off we go to collect the Pandemonic Energy!
MissionDeco1_2_1=Thank you for keeping me safe. How'd you like to become my assistant?

[Quest_10724]
StartQuest1=They severed the routes in preparation for the Pandemonium invasion...
StartQuest2=I must reconnect the routes using Rugard Holy Stone.

[//Quest_10735]
GreetingQuest1=(This energy is powerful, but I can't have it.)
GreetingQuest2=(Is it impossible to get the power I need to fight the Demon God?)

[Quest_1000001]
MissionDeco1_2_1=They're coming!!
MissionDeco1_3_1=There's more. Another wave incoming!!
MissionDeco1_4_1=Phew, what a relief. All thanks to you.

[Quest_1000002]
MissionDeco1_2_1=The monsters are here!

MissionDeco1_2_1=The monsters are here!
MissionDeco1_2_2=We have to be careful of them when moving!

[Quest_1000004]
MissionDeco1_1_1=There's no use hiding. Show yourself!!
MissionDeco1_3_1=Is there more?!
Mission1_1=We barely defeated them.

[Quest_1000005]
MissionDeco1_1_1=We just need to disarm the bomb, over there!
MissionDeco1_2_1=I failed...
MissionDeco1_3_1=It's disarmed...
MissionDeco1_4_1=What the...!!
Mission1_1=This should be enough.

[Quest_1000011]
StartQuest1=So this place, Dudrin, is a dominion of the Lorencia Kingdom.
Mission1_1=What the hell does the Lorencia Kingdom Army actually do?

[Quest_1000012]
StartQuest1=So this place, Dudrin, is a dominion of the Lorencia Kingdom.
Mission1_1=What the hell does the Lorencia Kingdom Army actually do?

[Quest_9599]
StartQuest1=Wait, is that... a Rift? Who the hell created it?
StartQuest2=Ah! I'm sure the Rift Research Society will know something about this.

[Quest_127]
MissionDeco1_1_1=There's nothing but impure iron here. I want newk.

[Quest_313]
MissionDeco2_1_1=There's nothing but dirt and sand here.

[Quest_5401]
StartQuest1=Those guards around the Queen aren't the Shadow Phantoms.
Mission1_1=Dark-skinned elves? They're wearing strange clothes.
Mission2_1=This is suspicious. I'd better meet Lunedill.

[Quest_5402]
StartQuest1=Is Breath of the World Tree at risk of war?
Mission1_1=This place is too quiet. I don't hear any clashing swords.
Mission2_1=Condors! What are they pecking at?

[Quest_5403]
Mission2_1=Nothing. They were just feasting on an animal carcass.
Mission3_1=Is that a village?

[Quest_5404]
Mission1_1=It's completely ruined. Did the Ashases do this?
Mission1_2=I'd better put out the fire before it completely burns the place down.
Mission3_1=Now the fire is contained.
Mission3_2=I'd better go to the village and look for survivors.

[Quest_5405]
StartQuest1=I have to go to the Chaber Fortress, but saving people comes first.
Mission3_1=I've saved all the villagers. I'd better head out to the Chaber Fortress.

[Quest_5406]
Mission1_1=The fortress is surrounded. I'd better help Iris.

[Quest_5407]
StartQuest1=This is a joint attack. I'd better take care of the Brolls on the east side first.
StartQuest2=I'd better get the stuff I need to destroy their base.
Mission1_1=I've got oil. I just need flint.
Mission2_1=You've got a good flint.
Mission3_1=This is for shaking hands with the Ashases.
Mission3_2=Now I just need to round up the remaining enemies.

[Quest_5424]
Mission1_1=This should do.
Mission2_1=Watchdogs, blame your owner.

[Quest_5408]
StartQuest1=I think Dark Green Shadows is west of here.
Mission1_1=This is Dark Green Shadows. What are those?
Mission2_1=The Ashases are using this device to supply power someplace else.
Mission2_2=I'd better destroy it, just in case.
Mission3_1=It's impossible to find all of these.
Mission3_2=Maybe it's better I find and destroy the recipient of power.

[Quest_5409]
Mission1_1=Ashases' weapons. Are they here to protect the recipient of power?

[Quest_5410]
Mission2_1=Is this the machine sucking up all the power in this place?
Mission3_1=Why was it digging the ground?

[Quest_5411]
StartQuest1=Were they digging the ground to reach the roots of the World Tree?
StartQuest2=I'd better investigate the World Tree.
Mission1_1=The World Tree is absorbing energy in the air and releasing powerful energy.
Mission1_2=I'd better do something.
Mission2_1=Destroying the chargers isn't enough.
Mission2_2=I must uproot the tree, so it can never be used again in war...
Mission3_1=The culture fluid is fed to the roots of the World Tree.

[Quest_5412]
Mission1_1=Destroying the operation device doesn't seem to work.
Mission1_2=But what if I open all the culture fluid feeders and overfeed the Tree?

[Quest_5413]
StartQuest1=The elves and the Ashases are blaming each other for the war.
StartQuest2=This is confusing. I'd better meet Iris.

[Quest_5414]
StartQuest1=Those Ashases. Not again!
Mission1_1=These thugs are blocking the way to the temple.
Mission1_2=Are they working for the Ashases?
Mission3_1=This should do. I'd better go to the temple now.

[Quest_5416]
StartQuest1=I knew there would be an army of Ashases here.
StartQuest2=I must scatter them first.

[Quest_5417]
Mission1_1=I've got all the blueprints. I'd better disarm the bombs now.
Mission2_1=Whew... I've disarmed them at last.

[Quest_5419]
Mission1_1=I've found the halidom. Where's the Guardian's Altar?

[//Quest_5420]
StartQuest1=Did the ritual really go well? Why can't I shake this bad feeling?

[Quest_5422]
Mission1_1=Iris said the stone imbedded in the statue was a war trophy from the war with Pandemonium two hundred years ago.
Mission1_2=This doesn't bode well. I'd better catch the girl who's stolen that stone.

[Quest_5431]
StartQuest1=These stowaways probably won't talk unless they get a good beating.
Mission1_1=That should draw their attention. Even the chief won't be able to ignore that.

[Quest_5433]
Mission1_1=It looks fine on the outside. I think I can just mend the hole that the Reptila mentioned.
Mission1_2=Maybe I can weave these plant stalks into something and fix it with it.
Mission3_1=Darn it, no. This hole is bigger than I thought.
Mission3_2=Hm? Is that... an elf?

[Quest_5434]
StartQuest1=I'd better rescue the farmers first.
Mission2_1=...Are they all dead?
Mission2_2=Orik Frog Beasts did this. Goblins must have let them loose.
Mission3_1=I hope the farm is safe. I'd better hurry.

[Quest_5435]
StartQuest1=Pillaging in the ravages of war? You bastards!
Mission1_1=Orik Goblins. They won't dare come back to this farm.
Mission2_1=A Slave Giant. He's so big!
Mission3_1=You shouldn't covet what others possess.

[Quest_5436]
StartQuest1=I must repair the stone launcher, and get to the national border.
Mission1_1=I'd better head out to the national border post now. I've been here too long.

[Quest_5437]
Mission1_1=Oh, no! The Queen's guards are butchering civilians!
Mission1_2=Those corpses will spread diseases if left unburied.
Mission3_1=Even the Ashas Army lost. This pile of corpses proves that.
Mission4_1=I don't have time. I hope the dead will forgive me for burning them like this.
Mission4_2=Those Dark Shadows... They must not be left alone.

[Quest_5438]
Mission1_1=This is for hurting the civilians. Beg for their mercy in Hell.
Mission2_1=Is this the Ashases' fortress?

[Quest_5439]
StartQuest1=Was the interruption during the Ashas Priests' telepathic communications the cause of the butchery?
StartQuest2=I'd better get to the Communion Shrine.

[Quest_5440]
StartQuest1=The Ashas archpriest is meeting with the elven knight commander. I hope there will be good news.
StartQuest2=Sigh, by the way, I still haven't found out where that girl is.

[Quest_5442]
StartQuest1=Slave merchants. The Dark Shadows are a despicable lot.
Mission1_1=Dantarexes? I'd better take care of these first.
Mission2_1=Where are the abducted villagers?

[Quest_5443]
StartQuest1=I'll see you can never trade people again.
Mission1_1=I think I've got enough fire arrows. Now, where's the ship?
Mission2_1=It's burning well. Alright, I'd better return to the Holy Bunker now.
Mission2_2=I wonder if those two have found that blue-skinned girl.

[Quest_5444]
StartQuest1=She waged war just to steal that blue gemstone. You mean, that little girl did?
StartQuest2=What is that gemstone, and who's this girl?
StartQuest3=I'd better go to the Pioneer's Ruins. I'll know everything if I catch that girl.

[Quest_5447]
Mission2_1=The Dark Shadows are making them pay for destroying their Sapientia Temple.

[Quest_5449]
Mission2_1=This is the Dark Mission's black magic. But... how?

[Quest_5480]
Mission1_1=This is the elves' library...
Mission2_1=I can't find any reference to the Blue Crystals here.
Mission3_1=The elves' customs... cultural styles... All these subjects are typical of modern times.
Mission4_1=Hm? This blue book... It looks pretty old.

[Quest_5482]
StartQuest1=Crescent Moon Island... The blue-skinned girl is there.

[Quest_5461]
Mission2_1=Whew, finally it's done.

[Quest_5483]
Mission1_1=This must be it. I should enter the house.

[Quest_5464]
Mission1_1=This must be the village that the Elder told me about.

[Quest_5465]
StartQuest1=The floor is wet with something... Is it... oil?
StartQuest2=Are they trying to lure the Elf Army and burn it alive? These cruel Nakans!
Mission1_1=Inside every building, there are enough explosives to burn down the entire village.
Mission2_1=This should take care of it.

[Quest_5466]
Mission1_1=I'm done now. I should go back to the Elder.

[Quest_5467]
StartQuest1=I must find the Nagas' cave. It's on the northwest side.
Mission1_1=I've arrived at the Nagas' cave.
Mission1_2=The Naga chief has the Mirror of Truth. I'd better find its den.
Mission2_1=Is that the Mirror of Truth...?

[Quest_5468]
StartQuest1=This is... Zakarian!?
StartQuest2=Is he after Neria's Tears!?
StartQuest3=This looks like the end of the Ashases. Drat, is he here in Noria!?
StartQuest4=I'd better go back to the safe house and tell him this.

[Quest_5469]
StartQuest1=Fratanne's teacher... I hope he knows about the place inside the Mirror.

[Quest_5470]
Mission3_1=I knew the Mission was responsible for this.
Mission3_2=I must find out where Zakarian is.

[Quest_5472]
Mission1_1=I've removed the contaminants. They must be what caused mutation in the sea creatures.
Mission2_1=These marks on the mutated creatures... The Mission...

[Quest_5473]
StartQuest1=I must go to Pilgrim's Rest.
StartQuest2=I hope Zakarian hasn't gotten ahold of Neria's Tears yet...

[Quest_5474]
StartQuest1=This is Pilgrim's Rest.
StartQuest2=The Dark Shadows must have invaded this far, just as I expected.
StartQuest3=I can't let them slaughter the villagers.

[Quest_5475]
StartQuest1=Are Neria's Tears inside this place? I'd better hurry.

[Quest_5478]
StartQuest1=What happened to the minds of the Ashases?
StartQuest2=I should go over to the Nungchentian Marshes and check.

[Quest_5501]
StartQuest1=The Ashases have mutated. How...?
Mission1_1=I don't see any traces of the Evil Energy or black magic.
Mission1_2=What caused this?

[Quest_5504]
StartQuest1=What the...? The mutants are casting a strange spell on the residents.

[Quest_5505]
Mission2_1=Oh no, the Telepathic Orb is contaminated. What's going on!?

[Quest_5506]
CompleteQuest1=Does the mutation in the Ashases have something to do with their minds?
CompleteQuest2=I don't understand this.

[Quest_5508]
StartQuest1=The Ashas Nakan and Broll alliance... It doesn't know when to give up.

[Quest_5509]
StartQuest1=This is where the elf prisoners are mobilized for forced labor.
StartQuest2=I'd better release as many of them as I can.

[Quest_5511]
StartQuest1=The Whispering Cave... Does it have some influence on the Ashases' minds?
StartQuest2=What are the Dark Shadows doing in there?

[Quest_5514]
StartQuest1=The mind of the Ashas Pope is the center of all the Ashas people...
StartQuest2=I must find Pope King Bellias before he sacrifices all Ashases.

[Quest_5515]
StartQuest1=Heinous Pandemonium scumbags, they're busy invading us physically as well.

[Quest_5516]
StartQuest1=This booming noise from the northeast side... Are they bombing us!?
StartQuest2=Damn! The Pandemonium scoundrels are bombing the ground to make it easy to invade.

[Quest_5517]
StartQuest1=The Psypher Stone is the telepathic device of the Ashases.
StartQuest2=It's tainted as well.

[Quest_5518]
Mission3_1=I've got Bellias's message. I'd better bring it to Merisha.

[Quest_5519]
StartQuest1=Sleighbowa, the capital city of Ashas.
StartQuest2=Pope King Bellias is there. I'd better move.

[//Quest_5522]
CompleteQuest1=With their main commanders defeated, the Dark Shadows won't be able to regroup for a while.

[Quest_5525]
Mission1_1=Am I inside Pope King Bellias's mind?
Mission1_2=I must remove the invading Pandemonic energy and help the Pope King.

[Quest_5527]
Mission1_1=Bellias...

[Quest_5529]
StartQuest1=Ribell... I hope you'll tell me the rest of the truth this time.
StartQuest2=I should go to Crescent Moon Island.

[Quest_5532]
StartQuest1=If Ribell is right... Queen Cara...!
StartQuest2=I must hurry back to Ethedrean.

[Quest_1601]
StartQuest1=A crime that seizes wartime opportunity. The culprit is a mean sort.

[Quest_1602]
Mission1_1=The dark elves that the monkey told me about. Are they the smugglers?

[//Quest_1606]
CompleteQuest1=Done. I hope this will help disrupt the Dark Shadows and Ashas Nakans' operation.

[Quest_1608]
StartQuest1=Is there pirate treasure somewhere on this island?
StartQuest2=It won't be easy to find.
Mission1_1=...There's nothing here.
Mission2_1=No, not here, either.
Mission3_1=Mm? I've found something.
Mission3_2=This... It's another map.

[Quest_1609]
StartQuest1=These nuisances!
StartQuest2=I hope this isn't another wild-goose chase...
Mission1_1=I knew it. There's nothing here.
Mission2_1=Nothing here, either.
Mission3_1=Mm? It's... yet another map.
Mission3_2=These pirates hid their treasure pretty well.

[Quest_1610]
StartQuest1=The pirate treasure... If I don't find it this time...
StartQuest2=I swear, this is the last time I'm looking.

[Quest_1636]
StartQuest1=Pirate treasure! Finally, I've found it!
StartQuest2=Gah, the pirates! Just my luck!

[Quest_1637]
Mission1_1=Pirate treasure... This looks like a good one.
Mission1_2=I'd better take it to the treasure hunter.

[Quest_1611]
CompleteQuest1=I've collected the telepathic communication device in Pattanmai.
CompleteQuest2=I'd better take it to the safe house.

[Quest_1613]
Mission1_1=I've collected the purest water of the waterfall.
Mission1_2=I'd better take it to the priest at the guard camp near Pilgrim's Rest .

[//Quest_1615]
CompleteQuest1=I've defeated the Naga chargers.
CompleteQuest2=I'd better report to the safe house.

[//Quest_1616]
CompleteQuest1=I've collected some pearls from the Nagas.
CompleteQuest2=Who knew Psypher Stones were made of these?

[//Quest_1619]
CompleteQuest1=I've collected everything in this place that looks peculiar.
CompleteQuest2=I'd better bring them to the treasure hunter outside the cave.

[Quest_1621]
Mission1_1=I've collected some usable wood from ents.
Mission1_2=I should bring it to the sailor at the port.

[Quest_1623]
StartQuest1=It was the Dark Shadows who were controlling the beasts.
StartQuest2=It's no use defeating the beasts alone. I must take care of them first.

[//Quest_1625]
CompleteQuest1=Alright, I've evacuated all the remaining villagers.
CompleteQuest2=Now only the Elder's left.

[Quest_1633]
Mission1_1=I should show this staff of his to the sailor.

[Quest_1635]
Mission1_1=The worst is over now that I took care of the most dangerous-looking enemy on the shore.
Mission1_2=I should report to the Rest Guard.

[Quest_1701]
StartQuest1=Dark elves who aren't happy with the Dark Shadows...
StartQuest2=They start showing their limits when it comes to military force.

[Quest_1702]
Mission1_1=I've gotten ahold of the orders from their commander.
Mission1_2=I hope they contain some useful information.

[Quest_1704]
Mission1_1=I've retrieved the items from the grave robbers.
Mission1_2=Judging by the strange energy it radiates, this must be the pentacle generator.

[Quest_1706]
StartQuest1=The Brolls are also in this swamp.
StartQuest2=They have their eye on both the elves' and the Ashases' bases.

[Quest_1708]
Mission1_1=This spring water activates spiritual energy...
Mission1_2=There are many things about the Ashases' civilization that I don't understand.

[Quest_1710]
Mission1_1=Can I get rid of the Pandemonium Army's territory marks with this?
Mission3_1=Alright, this should be enough to break the spirits of those Pandemonium scumbags.

[Quest_1711]
StartQuest1=First they attacked the Pilgrim's Rest, and now the Ashases' sanctum.
StartQuest2=Those Dark Shadows...

[Quest_1712]
StartQuest1=Ashas Pope King Bellias used to train in the Whispering Cave...
StartQuest2=Can I find the results of his training there?

[Quest_1713]
StartQuest1=These Pandemonium dirtbags! They broke out of the heated stratum to invade Earth!
StartQuest2=I hope I can find something to cool the surface of the earth in the Nagas' stronghold...

[Quest_1714]
Mission1_1=The surface of the earth is cooling. It seems to be working!

[Quest_1717]
CompleteQuest1=So, the Dark Mission isn't the real cause of the problem that the Ashases are experiencing.

[//Quest_1719]
CompleteQuest1=I've destroyed all the facilities occupied by the Dark Shadows.
CompleteQuest2=This should do some damage.

[Quest_1722]
Mission1_1=I don't see any more Psypher Stones.
Mission1_2=I hope this will help prevent the people's mind contamination from worsening.

[Quest_1723]
Mission1_1=I've disarmed all the accessories that the people had.
Mission1_2=I hope this will help alleviate their pain.

[Quest_1728]
Mission1_1=This vortex... It wasn't here to damage the artifact. It was protecting it!
Mission1_2=I shouldn't have done that.

[Quest_1729]
Mission1_1=I hope those fire elementals will stop coming.

[Quest_1730]
Mission1_1=Did this member of the Mission really control the minds of the people here?
Mission1_2=Something's not right...

[Quest_1731]
Mission1_1=It doesn't matter what color you are.
Mission1_2=What's important is what kind of person you are.

[Quest_9911]
StartQuest1=Now I know everything there is to know about the Pit of the Dead.
StartQuest2=I'd better go back to Dumpain.

[Quest_9610]
StartQuest1=Is this... another study? This one looks different from the last one.
StartQuest2=I'd better go to the Alchemist Merchant.

[//Quest_5453]
StartQuest1=This is frustrating. I should go meet Lunedill. I can't reason with the Queen.

[Quest_749]
StartQuest1=Hm? This looks like the Ashases' lab. Why is it connected to the Porystal?

[Quest_200103]
StartQuest1=That little dwarf lady. Was she called Dollan?

[Quest_200105]
StartQuest1=The Mining Association... I'd better go to the Weiss Basin.

[Quest_200108]
StartQuest1=Herman... Is he in league with the goblins?
StartQuest2=A tunnel connected to the Dudrin Village. I'd better hurry.

[Quest_200109]
StartQuest1=The east side of the Heath Mine. I must find it before the goblins do.

[Quest_200121]
StartQuest1=The darkness that has fallen over the Dudrin Village...
StartQuest2=I'd better talk to Ilina first.

[Quest_200122]
StartQuest1=Near Linda's place... This doesn't bode well.

[Quest_200126]
Mission1_1=Now it's time to check the cave.

[Quest_200502]
StartQuest1=The second daughter of Grand Duke Aeon. So Kali has a competitor.

[Quest_200506]
StartQuest1=The main body of Lightbringer... I hope Iope knows something about it.

[Quest_200509]
StartQuest1=The tomb of Queen Lenavis...
StartQuest2=May the sword be found at the tomb of Lenavis, the queen who stood against the Pandemonium forces until the last moment.

[Quest_200523]
StartQuest1=I knew there was a mole.
StartQuest2=The Blood Ice Peak. I hope he'll come here.

[Quest_200527]
StartQuest1=Orman. I'll put you to sleep once and for all.

[Quest_200901]
StartQuest1=Chaisong... Is he in Qwyinan?

[Quest_200902]
StartQuest1=Woongpam. I really hoped he didn't experiment on his own kind.
StartQuest2=Maybe the Datanses are the results.

[Quest_200905]
Mission1_1=I'd better return to Estesia now.

[Quest_200907]
StartQuest1=The Datanses have the Pectra energy! I'd better hurry.
Mission2_1=Someone has already taken quite a large amount of Pectra Energy.

[Quest_200911]
StartQuest1=There's a traitor among the Dracans Knights.
StartQuest2=I'd better warn Chaisong of this.

[Quest_200922]
StartQuest1=I'd better drop by the Guard Post in the Sanctum of the Elders and check the situation.

[Quest_200925]
StartQuest1=Kainan... I really hope he's here on behalf of Chaisong.

[Quest_201304]
StartQuest1=The members of the Dark Mission are a disgrace to their own kind.

[Quest_201305]
StartQuest1=What did this to the tree that symbolizes the Karol Kingdom?

[Quest_201307]
StartQuest1=Archpriest Laniere... What on earth happened to him?

[Quest_201322]
StartQuest1=Why did Queen Cara make that decision?
StartQuest2=Was it because of some incorrect information from the Dark Shadows?

[Quest_201325]
StartQuest1=The royal guards, instead of protecting their kingdom, have been colluding with the demons.

[Quest_201326]
StartQuest1=Iris was right about incorrect information being fed to Queen Cara.
StartQuest2=I really hope she'll believe me.
Mission2_1=Why would the Queen's aide do such a thing?
Mission2_2=I have to talk to Lunedill.

[Quest_201802]
MissionDeco1_1_1=Kobold? Haven't seen'em around here. I am sorry I couldn't be of more help.
MissionDeco2_1_1=No Kobold sighting was reported around here.
MissionDeco3_1_1=Kobolds in Karolsandria... No, I've never heard that before.

[Quest_746]
Mission1_1=It tastes awful.

[Quest_752]
Mission1_1=Better take a look around, then.
Mission2_1=Everyone, and everything has been affected. How can things go this bad?
Mission3_1=Animals, plants, and now people... This is the worst.
Mission4_1=Thump... Thump... What's that sound? What could be out there in front?

[Quest_201405]
Mission1_1=I've hunted many spiders. The curse on Petunia should be lifted by now.

[Quest_201552]
Mission1_1=I knew Zakarian's secret facility was here.
Mission1_2=I'm going to wipe out all the monsters here.
CompleteQuest1=Darn it, Zakarian. What did you do!? They won't stop coming. I'd better leave for now.

[Quest_201803]
Mission1_1=The Kobold workshop is here. Finally I've found it.
Mission1_2=Destroying their equipment should put out the fire for now.

[Quest_200204]
Mission1_1=Every Larva I've run into had this ore fragment.
Mission1_2=I'd better bring it to Jerome.

[//Quest_200206]
CompleteQuest1=I've collected all the materials I need to combine the ores.
CompleteQuest2=I'd better go back to the craftsman.

[Quest_200208]
StartQuest1=The stronghold of the Larvas in the Rift...
Mission2_1=I've destroyed the Larva stronghold.
Mission2_2=I'd better go back to the Lorencia Army.

[Quest_200209]
Mission1_1=I hope this is the high-ranking Larva's jewel...

[Quest_200210]
StartQuest1=The real fight has just begun.
StartQuest2=Just wait, you Larvas.
Mission2_1=I've destroyed all the souls that these Larvas had.
Mission2_2=I'd better take inventory first.

[Quest_200211]
Mission2_1=I've destroyed all the souls that these Larvas had.
Mission2_2=I'm almost done.

[Quest_200212]
Mission1_1=Cockroaches, I'll end your miserable lives.
Mission2_1=I've even destroyed the Larvas' last stronghold.
Mission2_2=What with so much damage, they wouldn't dare invade Earth again.

[Quest_200301]
StartQuest1=Persistent Pandemonium scum...
Mission2_1=Darn it, he came back to life again!
Mission2_2=Did I overdo it?

[Quest_200302]
StartQuest1=A stronger Larva King? I can't wait.
Mission2_1=Their evil energy in the forest has weakened.
Mission2_2=Now I can enter the area where the resurrected Larva King is.

[Quest_200402]
StartQuest1=Glasha might be alive...
StartQuest2=I fought him in the Weiss Basin the last time.
StartQuest3=I should go there first.

[Quest_200403]
StartQuest1=A Dwarven blacksmith who makes handicrafts...
StartQuest2=What does he want to make with Glasha's remains?

[Quest_200404]
MissionDeco1_1_1=Argh, help! Help me!

[Quest_200405]
StartQuest1=The heart of the mine... There has to be an entrance to the lower level somewhere around here.
Mission3_1=No. Glasha is not here.

[//Quest_200405]
CompleteQuest1=I think I've collected enough. I'd better return to that dwarf blacksmith.

[Quest_200407]
Mission2_1=I don't see any traces of Glasha here either.

[//Quest_200407]
CompleteQuest1=I've collected enough. I'd better go back to the Mining Association.

[Quest_200410]
StartQuest1=A terrifying sound is coming from the Rift in the east.
StartQuest2=What's going on!?
Mission1_1=What's this? I think this is... the Weiss Basin.
Mission1_2=Wait, did I just travel through time!?
Mission2_1=There were so many Pandemonium demons.
Mission2_2=So, this is Weiss Basin as it was in the past, when it was attacked by Pandemonium.

[Quest_200411]
StartQuest1=That accursed Glasha. I'll make sure he never resurrects again.
Mission1_1=Mm? Who's that over there?

[Quest_200414]
StartQuest1=Is Glasha in there?
Mission2_1=I don't see any Evil Crystals. I think I finished him for good this time.

[Quest_200603]
Mission1_1=These map pieces are so damaged, I can barely make them out.
Mission1_2=I'd better bring them to Joseph.

[Quest_200604]
StartQuest1=I should restore the Torn Map in my inventory.

[Quest_200609]
StartQuest1=I found this from a Gnoll. Is it... a Portal Stone?
StartQuest2=I think this will send me to their food warehouse in a Rift.
StartQuest3=Yes, the Portal Stone is responding to a Rift somewhere near this place.
Mission1_1=This is where they store the food that they stole.
Mission2_1=It's contaminated by toxins. I don't think it's edible.
Mission2_2=I'd better get rid of the Gnolls that keep this place first.
Mission3_1=This place is clear now.
Mission3_2=I'd better report back to Joseph.

[Quest_200611]
StartQuest1=The longer I wait, the greater the danger that threatens Duelden.
StartQuest2=I'd better collect these quickly.

[//Quest_200611]
CompleteQuest1=I've collected most of Ohrdor Group's Gold Coins.
CompleteQuest2=I'd better bring them to Dumpain.

[Quest_200612]
StartQuest1=Alright, I have to use this extractor and purify the food that the Gnolls have contaminated.
StartQuest2=I'd better move back to their warehouse.
Mission1_1=I've extracted all the toxins from the food.
Mission1_2=With this, the Tephakin Army shouldn't have a problem transporting the food.

[Quest_200613]
StartQuest1=These Gnolls... I'll end them.
Mission1_1=I've obliterated their invasion army, but just barely.
Mission1_2=I shouldn't have to worry about them, at least for a while.

[Quest_200702]
StartQuest1=The cause of the Gnolls' enhanced strength...
Mission1_1=Why are the members of the Gnoll Legion carrying these feathers?
Mission1_2=I'd better show them to the Silver Sparrowhawks.

[Quest_200703]
StartQuest1=The mythical creature worshipped by the Gnolls...
Mission2_1=Oh no, is their chief still alive?
Mission2_2=I'd better let Joseph know.

[Quest_200705]
StartQuest1=This should be enough to weaken the chief's power of wildness.
StartQuest2=Now it's time to get rid of him.
Mission1_1=They wouldn't stop resisting. Is this the power of wildness?
Mission1_2=But I'm going to put an end to them this time.

[Quest_200801]
StartQuest1=Icarus... Is he still in Duelden?

[Quest_200802]
StartQuest1=Studying Orman... I don't feel comfortable about this.
StartQuest2=Even so, I feel as if I should help him.

[//Quest_200802]
CompleteQuest1=I've collected anything and everything I could find from the remnants of the Pandemonium Army.
CompleteQuest2=I'd better bring them to Icarus.

[Quest_200803]
StartQuest1=I'd better check the nearest Rift.
Mission1_1=Finally, I got ahold of that thing that high-ranking Demons carry with them.
Mission1_2=I hope this will help translate the high-ranking Demons' language.

[Quest_200805]
Mission1_1=This must be it.
Mission1_2=Pedro is somewhere here. I'd better find him.

[Quest_200806]
Mission1_1=That fool... He must have a death wish.

[Quest_200807]
StartQuest1=Orman is from the Heavens? That's surprising.

[Quest_200808]
StartQuest1=Icarus must be out of his mind, wanting to restore Orman.
StartQuest2=But I know he's not going to stop this research.
StartQuest3=We'll have to see how this ends...

[//Quest_200808]
CompleteQuest1=With these, I've got everything that's needed to create Orman's body.
CompleteQuest2=I'd better bring them to Icarus.

[//Quest_200809]
CompleteQuest1=I've collected Garuda wings.
CompleteQuest2=I'd better bring them to Icarus.

[Quest_200810]
StartQuest1=Now I've got only one material left to collect.
StartQuest2=I must enter the Titan Excavation Site.

[//Quest_200810]
CompleteQuest1=The power that moves the Titans... It's incredible.
CompleteQuest2=I wonder if this can really restore Orman...

[Quest_201002]
StartQuest1=The dragons are gathering again.
StartQuest2=Are Neria's Tears involved again?

[Quest_201003]
Mission1_1=I've collected the special-looking parts of dragon scales.
Mission1_2=I'd better bring them to the Silver Sparrowhawks.

[Quest_201004]
Mission1_1=I've seized all the spell staves that the Dark Mission members carried.
Mission1_2=There's no way something like this would attract dragons.

[Quest_201005]
Mission1_1=I've seized all the sorcery tools that the Chakuas carried.
Mission1_2=I hope we're right this time...

[Quest_201006]
StartQuest1=Kyle... Something doesn't seem right.
StartQuest2=But for now, I have to do as he says.

[Quest_201007]
StartQuest1=There are even dragons inside the altar.
StartQuest2=This is getting worse.

[Quest_201008]
StartQuest1=Mm? What's that in front of the altar?

[Quest_201009]
StartQuest1=Making replicas of Neria's Tears...
StartQuest2=The Silver Sparrowhawks are taking great risks.

[//Quest_201009]
CompleteQuest1=I've collected all the research materials from those rare dragons.
CompleteQuest2=I'd better take them to Kyle.

[//Quest_201010]
CompleteQuest1=I've collected all the research materials from the ancient dragons.
CompleteQuest2=I'd better take them to Kyle.

[//Quest_201011]
CompleteQuest1=I've culled the dragons in this place.
CompleteQuest2=I hope Kyle has finished his research...

[Quest_201012]
StartQuest1=Imitation Neria's Tears... They look just like the real ones.
StartQuest2=I hope they'll work.
Mission1_1=Is this the place on the outermost edge of Earth?
Mission1_2=I'd better start setting up these Imitation Neria's Tears.

[Quest_201014]
CompleteQuest1=The dragon situation on the Litenberg Continent has now been resolved.

[Quest_201101]
StartQuest1=The Qwyinan Guard Unit is right: there are still many dragons around here.
StartQuest2=I'd better go to Kyle.

[Quest_201102]
StartQuest1=So, some intelligent dragons are commanding the others...
StartQuest2=I'd better go consult the Dracanem Elder Council.

[Quest_201103]
StartQuest1=A place in Duelden where intelligent dragons would take up residence...
StartQuest2=I can only think of the Dragon's Haven.

[//Quest_201103]
CompleteQuest1=I've collected the essences of the intelligent dragons.
CompleteQuest2=I'd better return to the Dracanem Elder Council.

[Quest_201104]
StartQuest1=Those intelligent dragons were hiding in the Closed Waterway.
StartQuest2=The beacon does not shine on its own base.

[//Quest_201105]
CompleteQuest1=I've defeated the guards of the intelligent dragon.
CompleteQuest2=Now I'd better go where their leader is.

[//Quest_201106]
CompleteQuest1=I've defeated all the intelligent dragons in the Waterway.
CompleteQuest2=I'd better deliver this news to Kyle.

[Quest_201201]
StartQuest1=The aftermath of the Evil Energy Tunnel after its destruction...
StartQuest2=I knew it'd leave a mark on this world somehow...

[Quest_201202]
Mission1_1=I've sensed ominous energy from the Wallkreiger spirit soldiers.
Mission2_1=I'm sensing ominous energy from the mutants swarming the highlands.
Mission3_1=I can sense ominous energy from the creatures inside the mine.
Mission4_1=The prisoners are radiating more evil energy than usual.

[//Quest_201202]
CompleteQuest1=Chaisong was right.
CompleteQuest2=Something evil remains, affecting this land.

[Quest_201224]
StartQuest1=Mm? Where does this entrance lead?

[Quest_201205]
StartQuest1=Who knew there was a breeding ground of Pandemonic creatures in a place like this?
StartQuest2=Maybe these are the cause of the lingering effects of Pandemonium on the continent.
StartQuest3=I'd better find and investigate all the other breeding grounds.

[Quest_201207]
StartQuest1=I've investigated all the hidden breeding grounds in this place.
StartQuest2=Now it's time to go to the Pit of Nightmares.

[//Quest_201230]
CompleteQuest1=I knew there'd be many hidden breeding grounds in this place.
CompleteQuest2=I'd better let the Mediah mages know about this.

[Quest_201211]
Mission1_1=I've collected enough Purifying Water.
Mission1_2=I'd better bring it to the Mediah mages.

[Quest_201212]
StartQuest1=The essence of nature... Where can I find something like that?
Mission1_1=This energy is indescribably pure.
Mission1_2=This must be the essence of Nature.

[Quest_201213]
StartQuest1=Alright, I'm going to start with the Pandemonic Cave.
Mission1_1=The Pandemonic creatures around me are weakening and dying.
Mission1_2=I think it's working. Next up is the Pit of Nightmares.
Mission2_1=Good, it worked here as well. Now, I've got only one place left.
Mission3_1=Oh no, Elyraq came back to life again!

[Quest_201214]
Mission1_1=I defeated him, but barely.
Mission1_2=With this, I've gotten rid of all the roots of Pandemonium left on this continent.
Mission1_3=I'd better report to Chaisong.

[Quest_234]
StartQuest1=I feel like someone's watching me. Is it that female researcher?

[Quest_201923]
StartQuest1=Ashas soldiers? Here? Are they here to take their revenge?

[Quest_201926]
MissionDeco2_1_1=Demons everywhere... What... What should we do?
MissionDeco2_5_1=Baraex! Stay close and never let go!
CompleteQuest1=Now... I'd better go back to Gildan. He must be at the Ruins Management Office.

[Quest_201935]
CompleteQuest1=Baraex was not the culprit... I should go back to Gildan and tell him what really happened.

Mission1_1=Is that the Realm of Perseverance?

[Quest_5611]
CompleteQuest1=Its entrance is tightly guarded. I'll have to fight my way through it.

[Quest_5613]
StartQuest1=That's... a siege tower? How did they get ahold of it?
StartQuest2=I'm going to destroy everything I see.

[Quest_5614]
StartQuest1=Is that where their leader is?
StartQuest2=I'd better get rid of their guards first.

[Quest_5617]
StartQuest1=Stone launchers... The chief was right.
StartQuest2=These Chakuas... Are they trying to wage war?

[Quest_5618]
StartQuest1=For now, I'm going to set their tents on fire and cause some confusion.
Mission1_1=Alright, I should take this chance and get to their command center where their chief is.

[Quest_5622]
Mission2_1=Mm... This should do.

[Quest_5625]
Mission1_1=This must be the incident report.
Mission1_2=I'd better move to the next base.

[Quest_5628]
Mission1_1=I don't think I can enter quietly because of those watchtowers.
Mission1_2=I should destroy just the watchtowers by the entrance and take a quick scan inside.
Mission4_1=Wait... The Kunikuluses have invaded! I'd better warn the base of this.

[Quest_5636]
Mission2_1=If this continues, their command center won't last long.
Mission2_2=What the hell is Yakan thinking?

[Quest_5631]
Mission1_1=Alright, time to raise a ruckus.

[Quest_1801]
Mission1_1=This... It looks like a newk ore.

[Quest_1810]
StartQuest1=Do they symbolize the demon god, Sekneum?
StartQuest2=These Kunikuluses have made some silly stuff.

[Quest_1814]
Mission2_1=This is the necklace. Brida must be happy.

[Quest_1816]
StartQuest1=Wait, this looks like an operation plan written by the Dracans Knights.

StartQuest1=Drat, I can't believe this happened.
StartQuest2=Even I didn't stand a chance against that power.
StartQuest3=Why are the gods so ruthless?
StartQuest4=If I want to resist their power... I must go there.

[Quest_500006]
CompleteQuest1=If this is correct, the Immortal, he's...

[Quest_500009]

StartQuest2=Should I go back to Elrond?

[Quest_500022]
StartQuest1=A strong presence on the Noria continent...
StartQuest2=It's got to be the Ashases' Restricted Area.

[Quest_500023]
StartQuest1=A strong presence on the Litenberg continent...
StartQuest2=Dracansor sounds like it.

[Quest_500024]
StartQuest1=Now I'm going back to the Noria continent...
StartQuest2=It must be the Kanturian ark that was discovered recently.

[Quest_500025]
StartQuest1=Alright, I've collected all the Karma I need for rebirth.
StartQuest2=I should go back to Elrond.

[Quest_202507]
StartQuest1=This sounds ridiculous, but the moment it becomes the truth, a calamity will befall us all.

[Quest_202510]
StartQuest1=What's my gift? I'd better open it.
Mission1_1=This is it? What about this other box?
Mission2_1=This is... incredible!

[Quest_300001]
StartQuest1=Mm, since I was reborn, I've been feeling restless.
StartQuest2=It's as if my soul is not where it should be.
StartQuest3=I'd better go back to Elrond and discuss this with him.

[Quest_300003]
StartQuest1=I should move to the Enova continent for now.
StartQuest2=I hope the thing I've got from Elrond will be useful.
Mission1_1=Elrond's magic wand is reacting.
Mission1_2=This is... The Bull Horn Legion is still here.
Mission1_3=I'm convinced. They have the strongest Warrior Souls in this place.

[Quest_300004]
StartQuest1=This isn't enough.
StartQuest2=Their real stronghold has to be somewhere around here.

[//Quest_300004]
Mission1_1=This is it. My magic wand is reacting more strongly.
Mission1_2=There must be someone with a stronger Warrior Soul.

[Quest_300005]
StartQuest1=This is the last Soul I can find in the Bull Horn Legion.
StartQuest2=Now, it's time I move on to the next continent.
Mission1_1=Warrior Souls can also be found in this place full of corpses...
Mission1_2=The strongest Warrior Soul in Duelden...
Mission1_3=Does one of these skeleton warriors have it?

[Quest_300006]
StartQuest1=I must find their real stronghold this time as well.

[//Quest_300006]
Mission1_1=This is it. My magic wand is reacting more strongly.
Mission1_2=There's someone with a stronger Warrior Soul here.

[Quest_300007]
StartQuest1=The next is the Litenberg continent.
Mission1_1=My target this time is... the Mada Legion.
Mission1_2=I should collect the Warrior Souls that they have.

[Quest_300008]
StartQuest1=Where's the real stronghold of these Madas?

[//Quest_300008]
Mission1_1=This is the Mada Legion's stronghold...
Mission1_2=I should find the stronger Warrior Soul.

[Quest_300009]
StartQuest1=Now I only have one place left to go to.
StartQuest2=Let's go to the Noria continent.
Mission1_1=This is it. The last place to collect Warrior Souls.
Mission1_2=The Brolls... They were warriors through and through.

[Quest_300010]
StartQuest1=I knew there was something else.
StartQuest2=I'd better enter their real stronghold.

[//Quest_300010]
Mission1_1=I should find the last Warrior Soul...
Mission1_2=...and stop the Brolls' atrocities while I'm at it.

[Quest_300011]
StartQuest1=This should do.
StartQuest2=The Warrior Souls I've collected so far are filling my soul.
StartQuest3=I should report back to Elrond.

[Quest_300021]
StartQuest1=Mm... I'm sensing the same spiritual dissonance as the last time...
StartQuest2=Rebirth is definitely not an easy thing to do.
StartQuest3=I'd better go back to Elrond again.

[Quest_300023]
StartQuest1=First, I should check the magic wand from Elrond.
StartQuest2=Mm, it seems the magic wand mainly points at the northern part of the Earth.
StartQuest3=There are the Litenberg and Noria continents in the north.
StartQuest4=I should search Litenberg first.
Mission1_1=Elrond's magic wand is reacting.
Mission1_2=Wallkreiger's Soul Knights have Knight Essences.
Mission1_3=I must collect their Knight Essences.

[Quest_300024]
StartQuest1=This isn't enough. Someone must have stronger Essence.
StartQuest2=It's not the Sanctum of Dragon Knights at which the magic wand is pointing...
StartQuest3=I'd better check the Rift.

[//Quest_300024]
Mission1_1=This is it. There's someone with stronger Knight Essence here.

[Quest_300025]
StartQuest1=I've collected all the Knight Essences that Wallkreiger's Soul Knights had.
StartQuest2=The next is... not far away from here. The Mining Gorge?
Mission1_1=This is... the Nobility Alliance?
Mission1_2=I can't believe even these scumbags carry Knight Essences.
Mission1_3=I don't like it, but I have no choice.

[Quest_300026]
StartQuest1=Are their main forces also stationed on the other side of the Rift?
StartQuest2=I must enter their stronghold.

[//Quest_300026]
Mission1_1=Just as I thought. I'd better search this place.

[Quest_300027]
StartQuest1=I can't sense any more Knight Essences in Litenberg.
StartQuest2=It's time I search the Noria continent.
Mission1_1=Breath of the World Tree. The knights occupying this place are...
Mission1_2=The Ashas Nakans.

[Quest_300028]
StartQuest1=They must have sneaked in through another hidden passageway...
StartQuest2=Through the Rift, of course.

[//Quest_300028]
Mission1_1=The Nakans have infiltrated through this place, just as I thought.
Mission1_2=There must be a Nakan with stronger Knight Essence here.

[Quest_300029]
StartQuest1=I'm almost done.
StartQuest2=Next is Wellspring Haven.
Mission1_1=The knights of the Dark Shadows, just as I expected.
Mission1_2=We're still at war. I have no reason to show them mercy.

[Quest_300030]
StartQuest1=Again, I'm sensing stronger Knight Essence on the other side of the Rift.

[//Quest_300030]
Mission1_1=Are these ruins occupied by the dark elves?
Mission1_2=My last target is the leader of the dark elves here.

[Quest_300031]
StartQuest1=This should do. I'd better go to the Temple now.
StartQuest2=The Knight Essences I've collected so far are filling my soul.
StartQuest3=I should report back to Elrond.

[Quest_1751]
Mission1_1=I wonder if she's escaped safely. Hopefully we'll meet again.

[Quest_1753]
Mission1_1=This is so dangerous. It seems the Rift Research Society is filled with freaks.

[Quest_1755]
StartQuest1=Riddles? What kind of amazing treasure are they hiding? I'd better look.

[Quest_1763]
Mission1_1=A new monument. I'd better relay its content to her.
StartQuest1=I'm starting all over again. Oh, well. I'll just find them one by one.

[Quest_1765]
Mission1_1=Rejoice to pay respect." I guess dancing was the right way to go about doing it.

[Quest_1766]
Mission2_1=Good! I should go back to Ethedrean now.

[Quest_1764]
StartQuest1=Alright, let's look again.

[Quest_524]
Mission1_1=Good, I've destroyed all their weapons. This should discourage them from trying an ambush.

[Quest_525]
Mission1_1=I don't think all nobles are like him, but...
Mission1_2=A few rotten apples spoil the bushel.

[Quest_1850]
StartQuest1=These bodies look like those of Dracans merchants. I'd better check.
CompleteQuest1=They were attacked from behind while running away. Those Nobility Alliance scumbags...

[Quest_1861]
Mission1_1=Alright, this should do.

[Quest_1862]
CompleteQuest1=This... Maybe I'm better off not knowing.

[Quest_1869]
StartQuest1=That's... It reminds me of what I saw on the Duelden continent.
StartQuest2=I think they're wardstones. I'd better destroy every one I see.

[Quest_1870]
CompleteQuest1=There are too many explosives just for hunting purposes.

[Quest_5705]
Mission1_1=Alright, I should put out the grain storage fire.

[Quest_5707]
Mission1_1=...I was too late. Is there a survivor?
StartQuest1=I believe almost everything is settled here.
StartQuest2=We should probably check the reservoir, too.

[Quest_5708]
Mission1_1=Now I should check the inside of the management office.

[Quest_5713]
Mission1_1=I think I've destroyed enough.

[Quest_5715]
StartQuest1=Drat, there are too many of them! I must distract them.
Mission1_1=Good, now I should go to the commander's tent.
Mission2_1=I've wasted too much time. I'd better get out of here.

[Quest_5717]
Mission1_1=It's led into the storage. I'd better hurry.

[Quest_5719]
MissionDeco1_1_1=Waaah! M-monsters! H-help!

[Quest_5723]
StartQuest1=These guys are definitely not hunters. They're here on a different mission.
StartQuest2=We'd better take care of them first.
CompleteQuest1=We must find the abducted Dracanses. I hope they're safe.

[Quest_5726]
StartQuest1=Geez, these scoundrels brought bombs!
Mission1_1=Good, finally I can take a breather.
StartQuest2=They're going to blow up the castle walls. We'd better get rid of all these bombs.
CompleteQuest1=Thank the gods, we found them before it was too late.
CompleteQuest2=Now that this place is cleared of the Nobility Alliance forces, I'd better go to the capital city, Qwahadan.

[Quest_5731]
MissionDeco1_1_1=Who is it! Who dares to damage Drapia royalty!

[Quest_5735]
Mission1_1=There are many wild Belbis. We cannot go much further like this.
Mission2_1=Is that... Drakans? What's a Drakans doing here?

[Quest_5743]
Mission1_1=Hm? That kid... *sigh*. I can't ignore that.

[Quest_5745]
CompleteQuest1=Surely, not common goblins. Something's behind this. I'm sure.

[Quest_5746]
CompleteQuest1=Now, shall we look for the boss?

[Quest_5748]
StartQuest1=Quadro... He was ready for anything. Since when did he make his decision?
StartQuest2=Let's see... now I have to cross that bridge over there. I'll have to hurry.
Mission1_1=The situation is not good. What could have happened here.
Mission1_2=I'll have to ask the villagers.

[Quest_5751]
StartQuest1=I've taken care of these plunderers... You said they were following Ungpam?
StartQuest2=The old woman may know more. I'll have to ask her.

[Quest_5752]
Mission1_1=Hm? Someone's calling me. Who can it be?
Mission1_2=It doesn't look like a trap. I'll have to go.

[Quest_5755]
StartQuest1=It's best to use a little physical force to talk to these guys.
Mission1_1=Now, their boss would be willing to talk.

[Quest_5756]
Mission1_1=Seeing this, said brother should be safe.

[Quest_5757]
CompleteQuest1=These are lost in evil thoughts. Could it be Quadro's plot?
CompleteQuest2=If I let this be... they'll be in pain as well. I guess there's no other way.

[Quest_5727]
Mission1_1=Um... Silver sparrowhawks? They're here too?

[Quest_5729]
StartQuest1=I spoke with the king, now I'll meet that Lemuria.
StartQuest2=At the envoy's residence, as I recall. Over at the right side.

[Quest_5733]
StartQuest1=Where did Quadro run to, why did this happened...
StartQuest2=Right now, I need more accurate information. I'll have to visit Lemuria again.

[Quest_5749]
CompleteQuest1=They won't dare think about plundering for a while.

[Quest_5754]
Mission1_1=It's disgusting. How deep do they trust Quadro to go this far?

[//Npc_ěš”ě • ěťŚěś ě‹śěť¸]
Sayhello1=Round and round, round and round, round we go a-dancing.
Sayhello2=Clap your hands, sing along. La la la, let's dance.
SayHello3=Ringa linga, ringa linga, ringa ling. Ringa linga, ringa linga, ling.
SayHello4=Hand in hand, all at once, let's dance for joy and fun.

[Quest_5803]
StartQuest1=I've gotten ahold of the information about the ancient elves fairly easily.
StartQuest2=Perhaps I should share it with that bard.

[Quest_5804]
StartQuest1=Mm? The bard's gone. Without a trace.
StartQuest2=It's as if he never existed. Unbelievable!
StartQuest3=Well, I'll just have to look for the ancient elves by myself.
Mission1_1=This... I've never seen this place before.

[Quest_5805]
StartQuest1=Something's written here. According to the dictionary from Coco, it means...
StartQuest2=Persuasion of peace. If you want to come here, calm the chaos around you first.
StartQuest3=Maybe this means I should take care of any threats in this place.

[Quest_5806]
StartQuest1=This should do. I hope it works.

[Quest_5807]
StartQuest1=It's a unique-looking forest.
StartQuest2=Is this where the ancient elves live?
Mission1_1=Elementals. Are they going to attack me?
Mission2_1=Mm? There are more elementals over there, but they look different.

[Quest_5814]
StartQuest1=This isn't enough.
StartQuest2=I must get rid of their leaders as well.

[Quest_5816]
StartQuest1=This isn't enough.
StartQuest2=I must get rid of their leaders as well.

[Quest_5817]
StartQuest1=Now they can no longer threaten the elementals.
StartQuest2=I should deliver this news to those who are isolated at the opening of the forest.

[Quest_5818]
StartQuest1=Even elementals have a hierarchy.
StartQuest2=I hope their leaders aren't too fussy...

[Quest_5819]
Mission1_1=I hope this is enough to bring peace back to the forest...
Mission1_2=Now, I should operate the totems of the ancient elves.
Mission2_1=The totems have been activated.
Mission2_2=I should report back to the Forest Monarch.

[Quest_5823]
StartQuest1=He's not willing to listen.
StartQuest2=I should talk to the other ancient elves.
MissionDeco1_1_1=I've got nothing to say. Please stop harassing me.
MissionDeco2_1_1=What? I've got nothing to say to strangers like you.
MissionDeco3_1_1=Hey, stop eavesdropping on us.
MissionDeco4_1_1=...Marchen? Why do you want to know about him?

[Quest_5824]
StartQuest1=I must translate the ancient elven language engraved here and there in the ruins.
StartQuest2=Perhaps I can use the ancient elven language dictionary from Coco.
Mission4_1=Good, this looks understandable.

[Quest_5827]
StartQuest1=Dance? Will this kind of ritual really work?

[Quest_5829]
Mission1_1=The illusion has disappeared.
Mission1_2=What was it trying to say?

[Quest_5835]
Mission1_1=I don't think I've seen this race before.
Mission1_2=Has this closed area been infiltrated by an external race?

[Quest_5838]
StartQuest1=The area occupied by the Black Forest tribe is northwest of here.
Mission1_1=They look just like the ones in Marchen's note.
Mission1_2=I'd better subdue the guards around here first.

[Quest_5839]
StartQuest1=Alright, time to storm their stronghold.
Mission1_1=Is that... a beacon mound? I'd better destroy it in case they try to communicate with their allies.

[Quest_5840]
StartQuest1=Now I've got only their leaders to take care of.
StartQuest2=I'm going to make sure they stay well away from this place.

[Quest_5842]
StartQuest1=Mm, what's that sound?
StartQuest2=A singing voice. This means...

[Quest_1956]
StartQuest1=They're small elementals, like Petunia. They're safe.
StartQuest2=I should take them to Petunia.

[Quest_1960]
StartQuest1=Alright, I've freed the king of the small elementals.
StartQuest2=I'd better take him to the Aide.

[Quest_1961]
StartQuest1=Alright, I've freed the queen of the small elementals.
StartQuest2=I'd better take her to the Aide.

[Quest_1962]
StartQuest1=I've saved both the king and queen of the small elementals.
StartQuest2=I should go back to Petunia.

[Quest_1982]
StartQuest1=These liches are the conjurors that support the Black Forests.
StartQuest2=Sorry, but you're barking up the wrong tree.

[Quest_1985]
StartQuest1=They've set up shop here.
StartQuest2=I'd better clean it as thoroughly as possible.

StartQuest2=Oh, well. I'll just have to keep exploring the Rift. I hope I'll get lucky.
Mission1_1=I've found the Rift Mana.
Mission2_1=Is this the Rift Sanctity?

[Quest_202656]
Mission1_1=Yes! I knew they were hiding in here!

[Quest_202657]
StartQuest1=But I can't ask the king directly. I should go to Chaisong.

[Quest_202712]
StartQuest1=This must be the place Remulia told me about.
StartQuest2=I should get some specimens of those elementals.

[Quest_202713]
StartQuest1=(Hm... Is Remulia...?)

[Quest_202714]
StartQuest1=Is this a habitat for mana-mutated shamas?
StartQuest2=Their bodily organs should be helpful in our research.

[Quest_202715]
StartQuest1=(Hah hah. I knew it!)
StartQuest2=(Let see... I wonder how Kundun is.)

[Quest_202722]
Mission1_1=So, this Rift is connected to the Ancient Dwarf Mine, huh?
Mission2_1=These ores look peculiar. I should take a few of them.

[Quest_202723]
Mission1_1=This blue one looks pretty.
Mission2_1=This red ore looks... strange.
Mission3_1=This green ore doesn't seem normal at all.
Mission4_1=A comforting yellow light. Maybe it can help me fall asleep.
Mission5_1=A black ore... Strange.
Mission5_2=I don't see anything else that looks special. I should give this stuff to him for now.

[Quest_202725]
StartQuest1=(It seems Caron wants to become independent from Kundun...)
StartQuest2=(Would Kundun let him?)

[Quest_202902]
Mission1_1=So, the Nobility Alliance officer was telling me the truth.
Mission1_2=Alright, it's time to let off some steam!

[Quest_202905]
StartQuest1=He said this was the last base, as far as he knew.
StartQuest2=I'd better go back and talk to the officer.
Mission1_1=Mm? Where did...? That's... a note?
